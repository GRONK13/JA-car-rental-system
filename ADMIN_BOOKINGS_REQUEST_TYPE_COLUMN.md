# Admin Booking Page - Request Type Column Implementation

## Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Purpose Column from Display**
- **Location**: `ManageBookingsTable.jsx` - BOOKINGS tab columns

## Visual Design

### Column Layout (BOOKINGS Tab)
```
ID | Customer Name | Car | Start Date | End Date | Balance | Request Type | Actions
```

### Color Coding System
Similar to the EXTENSION tab, each row is color-coded based on its status:

| Status | Icon | Background Color | Text Color | Hover Color |
|--------|------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| Payment Submitted | âœ… | Light Green (#e8f5e9) | Green (#2e7d32) | #c8e6c9 |
| Active Booking | ðŸš— | Light Blue (#e3f2fd) | Blue (#1976d2) | #bbdefb |
| Ongoing Rental | ðŸ”„ | Light Purple (#f3e5f5) | Purple (#9c27b0) | #e1bee7 |
| Awaiting Payment | ðŸ’° | Light Orange (#fff3e0) | Orange (#ed6c02) | #ffe0b2 |

---

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`ManageBookingsTable.jsx`**
   - Updated `tabSpecificColumns.BOOKINGS` array
   - Added `request_type` column with custom `renderCell`
   - Added `getRowClassName` function to DataGrid
   - Added CSS classes for row backgrounds (`.row-payment-submitted`, `.row-active-booking`, etc.)

### Code Structure

#### Request Type Column Definition
```javascript
{
  field: 'request_type',
  headerName: 'Request Type',
  flex: 2,
  minWidth: 200,
  resizable: true,
  renderCell: (params) => {
    // Logic to determine status and return color-coded Box
  }
}
```

#### Row Color Coding
```javascript
getRowClassName={(params) => {
  if (activeTab !== 'BOOKINGS') return '';
  
  // Determine status based on isPay and booking_status
  // Return appropriate CSS class name
}}
```
