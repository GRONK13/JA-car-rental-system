## üéì Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Always Both for Admin**
**Decision:** Admin receives both SMS and Email (no preference setting)  
**Reason:** Ensures critical booking alerts reach admin through multiple channels

### 2. **Centralized Config**
**Decision:** Admin contacts stored in separate config file  
**Reason:** Easy updates without modifying notification service code

### 3. **Non-Blocking**
**Decision:** Notification failures don't prevent booking creation  
**Reason:** Business continuity - bookings should succeed even if notifications fail

### 4. **Separate Try-Catch**
**Decision:** Customer and admin notifications wrapped in separate try-catch blocks  
**Reason:** Customer notification failure won't prevent admin notification

### 5. **Comprehensive Email**
**Decision:** Email includes full booking details vs SMS has summary  
**Reason:** SMS character limits vs email allows detailed information

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Multiple Admin Contacts**
   ```javascript
   ADMINS: [
     { name: 'Gregg', phone: '09925315378', email: 'gregg.marayan@gmail.com' },
     { name: 'Staff 2', phone: '09XXXXXXXX', email: 'staff2@example.com' }
   ]
   ```

2. **Role-Based Notifications**
   - Only notify admins with "booking_alerts" permission
   - Different notifications for different admin roles

3. **Notification Preferences for Admin**
   - Admin can choose SMS-only or Email-only
   - Time-based preferences (SMS during business hours, Email after hours)

4. **Rich Notifications**
   - Include car image in email
   - Direct link to booking in admin dashboard
   - Quick action buttons (Confirm/Contact Customer)

5. **Notification History**
   - Store admin notifications in database
   - View notification delivery status
   - Resend failed notifications
