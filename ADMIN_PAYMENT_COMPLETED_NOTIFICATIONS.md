## üéØ Summary

The notification system now provides complete visibility to admin/staff for all payment completions:

- **Cash Payments:** Admin notified when staff records cash payment
- **GCash Payments:** Admin notified when staff approves GCash payment

This completes the payment notification workflow, ensuring admin is always aware of:
1. When customers submit payment requests (existing)
2. When payments are completed/approved (NEW)

The implementation maintains the non-blocking design pattern, respects customer preferences, and provides comprehensive payment context in all notifications.
