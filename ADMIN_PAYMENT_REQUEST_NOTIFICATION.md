## 🎓 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Always Both for Admin**
**Decision:** Admin always receives both SMS and Email  
**Reason:** Payment requests are critical and need multiple delivery channels

### 2. **Include Reference Number**
**Decision:** Show reference number prominently in SMS and Email  
**Reason:** Primary identifier for verifying GCash transactions

### 3. **Different Instructions per Method**
**Decision:** Different verification steps for GCash vs Cash  
**Reason:** Verification process differs significantly between payment types

### 4. **Show Booking Context**
**Decision:** Include full booking details in notification  
**Reason:** Admin needs context to understand payment purpose without opening dashboard

### 5. **Calculate Remaining Balance**
**Decision:** Show remaining balance and full/partial indicator  
**Reason:** Helps admin understand payment progress and if booking is fully paid

### 6. **Non-Blocking Implementation**
**Decision:** Payment request succeeds even if notification fails  
**Reason:** Customer experience should not be disrupted by notification issues

### 7. **Include Payment Purpose**
**Decision:** Show payment description/purpose in notification  
**Reason:** Clarifies what the payment is for (booking, security deposit, etc.)
