# Booking Extension Notifications

## Overview
Added complete notification system for booking extension requests - admin notifications when customers request extensions, and customer notifications when extensions are approved or rejected.

**Implementation Date:** October 19, 2025

---

## üéØ Purpose

The extension notification system handles three key scenarios:
1. **Extension Request** - Customer requests to extend their ongoing booking
2. **Extension Approved** - Admin approves the extension request
3. **Extension Rejected** - Admin rejects the extension request

These notifications ensure both admin and customers are promptly informed about extension requests and their outcomes.

---

## üîî Notification Types

### 1. Admin Extension Request Notification
- **Trigger:** When `extendMyBooking()` is called by customer
- **Recipient:** Admin/Staff (always SMS + Email)
- **Timing:** Immediately when customer submits extension request
- **Purpose:** Alert admin that extension request needs review

### 2. Customer Extension Approved Notification
- **Trigger:** When `confirmExtensionRequest()` is called by admin
- **Recipient:** Customer (based on isRecUpdate preference)
- **Timing:** Immediately when admin approves extension
- **Purpose:** Inform customer their extension was approved and payment is needed

### 3. Customer Extension Rejected Notification
- **Trigger:** When `rejectExtensionRequest()` is called by admin
- **Recipient:** Customer (based on isRecUpdate preference)
- **Timing:** Immediately when admin rejects extension
- **Purpose:** Inform customer their extension was denied

## üîÑ Integration Points

### 1. Extension Request Flow
**File:** `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js`

**Function:** `extendMyBooking()`

```javascript
// Customer submits extension request
const updatedBooking = await prisma.booking.update({
  where: { booking_id: bookingId },
  data: {
    isExtend: true,
    new_end_date: newEndDate,
    total_amount: newTotalAmount,
    balance: newBalance,
    payment_status: 'Unpaid'
  }
});

// Send admin notification (NEW)
await sendAdminExtensionRequestNotification(
  updatedBooking,
  customer,
  car,
  additionalDays,
  additionalCost
);
```

**Flow:**
1. Customer requests extension via customer dashboard
2. System calculates additional days and cost
3. Booking updated with `isExtend: true` and `new_end_date`
4. Additional cost added to `total_amount` and `balance`
5. Admin receives extension request notification ‚≠ê NEW

---

### 2. Extension Approval Flow
**File:** `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js`

**Function:** `confirmExtensionRequest()`

```javascript
// Admin approves extension
await prisma.extension.create({
  data: {
    booking_id: bookingId,
    old_end_date: booking.end_date,
    new_end_date: booking.new_end_date
  }
});

const updatedBooking = await prisma.booking.update({
  where: { booking_id: bookingId },
  data: {
    end_date: booking.new_end_date,
    new_end_date: null,
    isExtend: false,
    payment_status: 'Unpaid'
  }
});

// Send customer notification (NEW)
await sendExtensionApprovedNotification(
  updatedBooking,
  customer,
  car,
  additionalDays,
  additionalCost
);
```

**Flow:**
1. Admin reviews extension request in admin dashboard
2. Admin clicks "Approve Extension"
3. Extension record created in database
4. Booking's `end_date` updated to `new_end_date`
5. `isExtend` flag cleared, `new_end_date` cleared
6. Customer receives extension approved notification ‚≠ê NEW

---

### 3. Extension Rejection Flow
**File:** `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js`

**Function:** `rejectExtensionRequest()`

```javascript
// Admin rejects extension
const restoredTotalAmount = booking.total_amount - additionalCost;
const restoredBalance = booking.balance - additionalCost;

const updatedBooking = await prisma.booking.update({
  where: { booking_id: bookingId },
  data: {
    new_end_date: null,
    isExtend: false,
    total_amount: restoredTotalAmount,
    balance: restoredBalance,
    payment_status: paymentStatus
  }
});

// Send customer notification (NEW)
await sendExtensionRejectedNotification(

  additionalDays,
  additionalCost
);
```

**Flow:**
1. Admin reviews extension request in admin dashboard

## üìä Extension Notification Matrix

| Event | Admin Notification | Customer Notification |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Customer Requests Extension** | ‚úÖ Extension Request (SMS + Email) | ‚ùå No |
| **Admin Approves Extension** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Extension Approved (based on isRecUpdate) |
| **Admin Rejects Extension** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Extension Rejected (based on isRecUpdate) |

---

## üí° Business Logic

### Extension Request Validation
- Only bookings with status "ongoing" or "in progress" can be extended
- Cannot request extension if `isExtend` is already true (pending request)
- New end date must be after current end date
- Additional cost calculated as: `additionalDays √ó rent_price`

### Extension Approval
- Creates permanent `Extension` record in database
- Updates `end_date` to the requested `new_end_date`
- Updates `dropoff_time` preserving original time but using new date
- Sets `payment_status` to 'Unpaid' due to additional balance

### Extension Rejection
- Removes additional cost from `total_amount` and `balance`
- Restores original booking terms
- Updates `payment_status` based on restored balance
- No extension record created

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Admin Contact Settings
**File:** `backend/src/config/adminNotificationConfig.js`

```javascript
export const ADMIN_NOTIFICATION_CONFIG = {
  PHONE: '09925315378',
  EMAIL: 'gregg.marayan@gmail.com',
  BUSINESS_NAME: 'JA Car Rental'
};
```

### Customer Notification Preferences
Controlled by `isRecUpdate` field:
- `0` = No notifications
- `1` = SMS only
- `2` = Email only
- `3` = Both SMS and Email

**Note:** Admin notifications always send both SMS and Email regardless of preferences.
