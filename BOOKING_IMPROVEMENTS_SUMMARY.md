# Booking System Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Date: October 23, 2025

This document summarizes the 4 major improvements made to the booking system based on teammate requirements.

---

## 1. ‚úÖ Updated Pickup and Drop-off Time Restrictions

### Previous Behavior:
- Both pickup and drop-off times were restricted to 7:00 AM - 7:00 PM (office hours)

### New Behavior:
- **Pickup Time**: 24/7 availability (no restrictions)
- **Drop-off Time**: 7:00 AM - 12:00 AM (Midnight) - 17-hour window

### Changes Made:

#### Backend (`BookingModal.jsx` - Line ~420):
```javascript
// Pickup time (24/7 - no restrictions)
// No validation needed

// Drop-off time (must be between 7:00 AM - 12:00 AM / Midnight)
if (formData.dropoffTime) {
  const [dropoffHour, dropoffMinute] = formData.dropoffTime.split(':').map(Number);
  const dropoffTimeInMinutes = dropoffHour * 60 + dropoffMinute;
  const minTime = 7 * 60; // 7:00 AM
  const maxTime = 24 * 60; // 12:00 AM (Midnight)

  // Allow 00:00 (midnight) as valid dropoff time
  const isValidDropoffTime = (dropoffTimeInMinutes >= minTime && dropoffTimeInMinutes < maxTime) || dropoffTimeInMinutes === 0;

  if (!isValidDropoffTime) {
    setError('Drop-off time must be between 7:00 AM and 12:00 AM (Midnight)');
    // ... error handling
  }
}
```

#### Frontend UI Updates:
- Added helpful labels: "Pickup Time * (24/7 Available)" and "Drop-off Time * (7 AM - 12 AM)"
- Added caption text below time inputs:
  - "‚è∞ Pickup available anytime, 24 hours a day"
  - "üïê Drop-off hours: 7:00 AM - 12:00 AM (Midnight)"

## 2. ‚úÖ Driver Availability Checking

### Requirement:
Drivers cannot be chosen if they have conflicting bookings for the selected dates. Check availability before allowing selection.

### Implementation:

#### Backend - New Endpoint (`driverController.js`):
```javascript
// GET /drivers/:id/availability?startDate=2025-11-01&endDate=2025-11-05
export const checkDriverAvailability = async (req, res) => {
  // Checks if driver has conflicting bookings (Pending, Confirmed, In Progress)
  // Returns: { available: true/false, conflicting_bookings: [...] }
}
```

#### Backend - Route (`driverRoutes.js`):
```javascript
router.get("/:id/availability", verifyToken, checkDriverAvailability);
```

#### Frontend - Availability Checking (`BookingModal.jsx`):
1. **Real-time Validation**: When customer selects dates, system automatically checks all drivers' availability
2. **Visual Indicators**: 
   - Available drivers: Normal display with green check
   - Unavailable drivers: Grayed out, orange border, "Unavailable" chip, cannot be selected
3. **Auto-deselection**: If selected driver becomes unavailable due to date change, selection is cleared with warning message

#### Key Functions:
```javascript
const checkDriverAvailability = async (driverId, startDate, endDate) => {
  // Calls backend API to check if driver is free
}

const updateDriversAvailability = async () => {
  // Updates all drivers' availability status when dates change
  // Clears selection if current driver becomes unavailable
}

useEffect(() => {
  // Automatically checks availability when dates change
  if (formData.startDate && formData.endDate && !isSelfService) {
    updateDriversAvailability();
  }
}, [formData.startDate, formData.endDate]);
```

## 3. ‚úÖ Block Unavailable Dates from Selection

### Requirement:
Customers should not be able to select dates that are already booked or under maintenance for the car.

### Implementation:

#### Real-time Date Validation (`BookingModal.jsx`):
```javascript
const handleInputChange = (field, value) => {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Validate date selection against unavailable periods
  if ((field === 'startDate' || field === 'endDate') && value) {
    const dateToCheck = new Date(value);
    
    // Check if selected date falls within any unavailable period
    const conflictingPeriod = unavailablePeriods.find(period => {
      const periodStart = new Date(period.start_date);
      const periodEnd = new Date(period.end_date);
      
      return dateToCheck >= periodStart && dateToCheck <= periodEnd;
    });
    
    if (conflictingPeriod) {
      setError(`‚ùå The date you selected falls within an unavailable period. Please choose a different date.`);
      setHasDateConflict(true);
      return;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Form Submission Validation:
```javascript
const validateForm = () => {
  // ... existing validations ...
  
  // Validate booking dates don't conflict with unavailable periods
  for (const period of unavailablePeriods) {
    // Check if date ranges overlap
    const hasOverlap = bookingStartDate <= periodEnd && bookingEndDate >= periodStart;
    
    if (hasOverlap) {
      setError(`‚ùå Your booking dates conflict with an unavailable period...`);
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

### Features:
1. **Immediate Feedback**: Error shown as soon as conflicting date is selected
2. **Double Validation**: Checked both during input and form submission
3. **Clear Error Messages**: Tells customer exactly which period conflicts and why
4. **Visual Warning Box**: Unavailable periods displayed prominently with color coding:
   - üöó Orange: Currently rented
   - üìÖ Blue: Future bookings
   - üîß Red: Maintenance periods

## 4. ‚úÖ Self-Drive License Requirement

### Requirement:
If customer has no driver license on file (`driver_license_no` is NULL), they cannot select self-drive service.

### Implementation:

#### Customer Data Fetching (`BookingModal.jsx`):
```javascript
const [customerData, setCustomerData] = useState(null);
const [hasDriverLicense, setHasDriverLicense] = useState(true);

const fetchCustomerData = async () => {
  const response = await authenticatedFetch(`${API_BASE}/api/customers/me`);
  
  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json();
    setCustomerData(data);
    
    // Check if customer has driver license
    const hasLicense = data.driver_license_no && data.driver_license_no.trim() !== '';
    setHasDriverLicense(hasLicense);
    
    // If no license, disable self-drive by default
    if (!hasLicense) {
      setIsSelfService(false);
    }
  }
};

useEffect(() => {
  if (open && car) {
    fetchCustomerData(); // Fetch on modal open
  }
}, [open, car]);
```

#### Self-Drive Toggle with Validation:
```javascript
<Switch
  checked={isSelfService}
  onChange={(e) => {
    if (!hasDriverLicense && e.target.checked) {
      setError('You cannot select self-drive service because you do not have a driver license on file. Please add your driver license in your account settings or choose a driver.');
      return;
    }
    setIsSelfService(e.target.checked);
    setError('');
  }}
  disabled={!hasDriverLicense}
/>
```

#### UI Indicators:
1. **Lock Icon**: üîí shown next to "Self-Drive Service" when disabled
2. **Disabled State**: Switch is grayed out and cannot be toggled
3. **Informative Message**: 
   - With license: "You will drive the car yourself"
   - Without license: "‚ùå Self-drive not available - No driver license on file"
4. **Error Alert**: Clear message if customer attempts to enable self-drive without license

- `Driver` bookings checked via `Booking` table
- `Car` unavailable periods via `Booking` table with maintenance calculation

1. **GET** `/drivers/:id/availability?startDate=YYYY-MM-DD&endDate=YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Returns driver availability status
   - Response: `{ available: boolean, conflicting_bookings: number, conflicts: [...] }`

### Existing Endpoints:
1. **GET** `/api/customers/me` - Fetch customer data with license info
2. **GET** `/cars/:id/unavailable-periods` - Fetch car's blocked dates
3. **GET** `/drivers` - Fetch all drivers

---

## Error Messages

### User-Friendly Messages:
1. **Time Error**: "Drop-off time must be between 7:00 AM and 12:00 AM (Midnight)"
2. **Date Conflict**: "‚ùå The date you selected (Oct 25) falls within an unavailable period (Oct 20 - Oct 30). Booked by another customer. Please choose a different date."
3. **Driver Unavailable**: "‚ö†Ô∏è The previously selected driver is not available for the chosen dates. Please select another driver."
4. **No License**: "You cannot select self-drive service because you do not have a driver license on file. Please add your driver license in your account settings or choose a driver."
5. **Date Range Overlap**: "‚ùå Your booking dates conflict with an unavailable period: Oct 20 - Oct 30. Booked by another customer. Please choose different dates that don't overlap with the blocked periods shown above."

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

1. **Visual Calendar Component**: Replace native date input with calendar that visually blocks unavailable dates (gray out or disable)
2. **Driver Schedule View**: Admin panel to view all driver schedules in calendar format
3. **Email Notifications**: Notify customer if their selected driver becomes unavailable
4. **Batch Availability Check**: Optimize to check all drivers in single API call instead of individual requests
5. **License Upload Prompt**: Add direct link/button to upload license from booking modal

---

## Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- No breaking changes to existing bookings
- Existing customers without license can still book with drivers
- System gracefully handles edge cases (midnight, date boundaries, etc.)
- All validations happen on both frontend and backend for security
