# Booking Logic Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Date: October 9, 2025

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes applied to the booking system to address critical issues with booking status, payment flow, and user experience.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Booking Status - Changed from "pending_payment" to "Pending"
**Problem:** The booking status was set to "pending_payment" which didn't match the expected status values.

**Solution:**
- Changed booking status from `'pending_payment'` to `'Pending'` (capitalized)
- Updated status in `BookingModal.jsx` line ~468
- Customers can now properly edit and cancel "Pending" bookings

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/BookingModal.jsx`

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Before:
booking_status: 'pending_payment'

// After:
booking_status: 'Pending' // Customer can still edit/cancel
```

---

### 2. ✅ Remove Automatic Payment - Allow Edit/Cancel for Pending Bookings
**Problem:** System was treating bookings as if they required immediate payment, preventing edits.

**Solution:**
- Bookings now stay in "Pending" status after creation
- Customers can edit or cancel pending bookings
- Payment is optional and can be made later through "Pay Now" button
- Updated `CustomerBookings.jsx` to show Edit/Cancel buttons for "Pending" status

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerBookings.jsx`

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Edit Button - Show for pending bookings (case-insensitive)
{booking.booking_status?.toLowerCase() === 'pending' && (
  <Button onClick={() => setShowEditDialog(true)}>Edit</Button>
)}

// Cancel Button - Show for pending bookings
{booking.booking_status?.toLowerCase() === 'pending' && (
  <Button onClick={() => setShowCancelDialog(true)}>Cancel</Button>
)}

// Pay Now Button - Show for bookings with outstanding balance (except cancelled/completed)
{booking.has_outstanding_balance && 
 booking.booking_status?.toLowerCase() !== 'cancelled' && 
 booking.booking_status?.toLowerCase() !== 'completed' && (
  <Button onClick={() => setShowPaymentDialog(true)}>Pay Now</Button>
)}
```

---

### 3. ✅ Populate Initial Values in Edit Booking Modal
**Problem:** When editing a booking, form fields were empty causing errors when trying to save.

**Solution:**
- `NewEditBookingModal.jsx` now properly initializes all form fields with booking data
- All fields are pre-populated when modal opens
- Prevents validation errors on save

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/NewEditBookingModal.jsx`

**Code Change:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (booking && open) {
    setFormData({
      purpose: booking.purpose || '',
      customPurpose: booking.purpose === 'Others' ? (booking.purpose_details || '') : '',
      startDate: booking.start_date ? new Date(booking.start_date).toISOString().split('T')[0] : '',
      endDate: booking.end_date ? new Date(booking.end_date).toISOString().split('T')[0] : '',
      pickupTime: booking.pickup_time || '',
      dropoffTime: booking.dropoff_time || '',
      deliveryLocation: booking.delivery_location || '',
      dropoffLocation: booking.dropoff_location || '',
      selectedDriver: booking.drivers_id ? booking.drivers_id.toString() : '',
    });
    // ... rest of initialization
  }
}, [booking, open]);
```

---

### 4. ✅ Remove Special Requests Field from Booking
**Problem:** Special requests field was unnecessary and cluttering the booking form.

**Solution:**
- Removed `specialRequests` field from `BookingModal.jsx`
- Removed `specialRequests` field from `NewEditBookingModal.jsx`
- Removed field from form data state
- Removed field from booking submission data
- Removed UI components displaying the field

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/BookingModal.jsx`
- `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/NewEditBookingModal.jsx`

**Code Removed:**
```javascript
// From formData state:
specialRequests: '',

// From booking submission:
specialRequests: formData.specialRequests,

// From UI (NewEditBookingModal.jsx lines 451-460):
<Grid item xs={12}>
  <TextField
    label="Special Requests (Optional)"
    value={formData.specialRequests}
    onChange={(e) => setFormData({ ...formData, specialRequests: e.target.value })}
    multiline
    rows={3}
  />
</Grid>
```

---

### 5. ✅ Reference Number Only for GCash Payments
**Problem:** Reference number was required for both Cash and GCash payments, but Cash payments don't have reference numbers.

**Solution:**
- Updated `PaymentModal.jsx` to only require reference number for GCash payments
- Reference number field only displays for GCash payment method
- Cash payments only show amount field
- Confirmation step only shows reference number for GCash payments
- Updated `CustomerBookings.jsx` Settlement tab to only display reference number for GCash payments

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/PaymentModal.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerBookings.jsx`

**Code Changes:**

**PaymentModal.jsx - Validation:**
```javascript
// Updated validation
if (paymentData.payment_method === 'GCash') {
  if (!paymentData.gcash_no) {
    setError('Please enter your GCash number');
    return false;
  }
  if (!/^09\d{9}$/.test(paymentData.gcash_no)) {
    setError('Please enter a valid GCash number (09XXXXXXXXX)');
    return false;
  }
  if (!paymentData.reference_no) {
    setError('Please enter the GCash reference number');
    return false;
  }
}
// Note: No reference_no validation for Cash payments
```

**PaymentModal.jsx - UI Display:**
```javascript
// Reference Number field - Only show for GCash
{paymentData.payment_method === 'GCash' && (
  <Grid item xs={12}>
    <TextField
      fullWidth
      label="Reference Number *"
      value={paymentData.reference_no}
      onChange={(e) => handleInputChange('reference_no', e.target.value)}
      placeholder="Enter GCash reference number"
      required
      helperText="Enter the reference number from your GCash transaction"
    />
  </Grid>
)}

// Confirmation step - Only show GCash details for GCash payments
{paymentData.payment_method === 'GCash' && (
  <>
    <Divider />
    <Box>
      <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">GCash Number</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">{paymentData.gcash_no}</Typography>
    </Box>
    
    <Divider />
    <Box>
      <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">Reference Number</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">{paymentData.reference_no}</Typography>
    </Box>
  </>
)}
```

**CustomerBookings.jsx - Settlement Tab:**
```javascript
// Only show GCash details for GCash payments
{payment.payment_method === 'GCash' && payment.gcash_no && (
  <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
    GCash: {payment.gcash_no}
  </Typography>
)}
{payment.payment_method === 'GCash' && payment.reference_no && (
  <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
    Ref: {payment.reference_no}
  </Typography>
)}
```

## Status Color Updates

Added "Confirmed" status to color mapping for better status display:

```javascript
const getStatusColor = (status) => {
  switch (status?.toLowerCase()) {
    case 'pending': return 'warning';
    case 'approved': return 'info';
    case 'confirmed': return 'info';  // Added
    case 'ongoing': return 'primary';
    case 'completed': return 'success';
    case 'cancelled': return 'error';
    default: return 'default';
  }
};
```

## User Flow After Fixes

### 2. **Editing a Pending Booking**
1. Customer clicks "Edit" button on pending booking
2. `NewEditBookingModal` opens with all fields pre-populated
3. Customer can modify dates, times, locations, driver selection, etc.
4. Changes are saved successfully
5. Booking remains in "Pending" status

### 3. **Cancelling a Pending Booking**
1. Customer clicks "Cancel" button on pending booking

## Backend Considerations

The following backend endpoints may need review to ensure consistency:

1. **POST /bookings** - Should accept "Pending" status
2. **PUT /bookings/:id/update** - Should allow updates for "Pending" status
3. **PUT /bookings/:id/cancel** - Should allow cancellation of "Pending" bookings
4. **POST /payments/process-booking-payment** - Should handle optional reference_no for Cash payments
