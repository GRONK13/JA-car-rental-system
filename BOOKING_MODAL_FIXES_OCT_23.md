# Booking Modal Fixes - October 23, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ 403 Forbidden Error on `/manage-fees` Endpoint

**Problem:**
- Customers were getting `403 Forbidden` when trying to fetch registration fees
- The endpoint was restricted to admin/staff only
- Customers need to read fees to calculate total booking costs

**Solution:**
- Modified `backend/src/routes/manageFeesRoutes.js`
- Changed GET `/manage-fees` route from `verifyToken, adminOrStaff` to just `verifyToken`
- Customers can now READ fees, but only admin/staff can UPDATE fees (PUT route still protected)

**Files Changed:**
```javascript
// Before:
router.get('/', verifyToken, adminOrStaff, getFees);

// After:
router.get('/', verifyToken, getFees); // Customers can read fees
router.put('/', verifyToken, adminOrStaff, updateFees); // Only admin/staff can update
```

### 2. ❌ 500 Internal Server Error on Driver Availability Checks

**Problem:**
- When selecting dates in booking modal, all drivers showed as "Unavailable"
- Console showed 500 Internal Server Error for `/drivers/:id/availability` endpoint
- Error was caused by incorrect field name in database query

**Root Cause:**
- The `checkDriverAvailability` function used `driver_id` field
- But Prisma schema uses `drivers_id` (with 's')
- This caused database query to fail

**Solution:**
- Modified `backend/src/controllers/driverController.js`
- Changed `driver_id` to `drivers_id` in the booking query

**Files Changed:**
```javascript
// Before:
const conflictingBookings = await prisma.booking.findMany({
  where: {
    driver_id: driverId,  // ❌ Wrong field name
    ...
  }
});

// After:
const conflictingBookings = await prisma.booking.findMany({
  where: {
    drivers_id: driverId,  // ✅ Correct field name matching Prisma schema
    ...
  }
});
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### ✅ Fees Loading
1. Open booking modal
2. Registration fee should load automatically
3. Total cost calculation should work correctly
4. No more 403 errors in console

### ✅ Driver Availability
1. Open booking modal
2. Select start and end dates
3. Drivers should update availability status automatically
4. Available drivers: Normal appearance, can be selected
5. Unavailable drivers: Grayed out with "Unavailable" chip
6. No more 500 errors in console

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open booking modal - no console errors
- [ ] Check that registration fee displays correctly
- [ ] Select dates with NO conflicting bookings - all available drivers should be selectable
- [ ] Select dates that overlap with existing bookings - conflicting drivers should show "Unavailable"
- [ ] Select an available driver - should work normally
- [ ] Try to select an unavailable driver - should be disabled/grayed out
- [ ] Submit booking with valid dates and available driver - should succeed

## Related Files

**Backend:**
- `backend/src/routes/manageFeesRoutes.js` - Removed admin restriction from GET route
- `backend/src/controllers/driverController.js` - Fixed field name in driver availability query

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/BookingModal.jsx` - Already has driver availability checking implemented

**Database:**
- Prisma schema: `Booking.drivers_id` (not `driver_id`)

## Notes for Future Development

1. **Consistent Field Naming:** The database uses `drivers_id` in Booking table, but `driver_id` in other contexts. Consider standardizing.

2. **Error Handling:** The driver availability function now properly catches and logs errors for debugging.

3. **Permission Model:** Customers can READ fees but cannot UPDATE them - this is the correct security model.

4. **Availability Logic:** The function checks for bookings with status 'Pending', 'Confirmed', or 'In Progress' and `isCancel = false` to determine driver conflicts.
