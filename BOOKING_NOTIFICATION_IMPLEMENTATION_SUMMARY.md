# Booking Notification System - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Feature Overview
Implemented an automated notification system that sends SMS and email to customers at two critical points in the booking journey:
1. **When they successfully create a booking** - with payment deadline information
2. **When their booking is confirmed** - after payment verification

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. New Notification Functions
**File:** `backend/src/utils/notificationService.js`

Added three new functions:
- `calculatePaymentDeadline()` - Calculates when customer must pay based on booking start date
- `sendBookingSuccessNotification()` - Sends initial booking notification with payment deadline
- `sendBookingConfirmationNotification()` - Sends confirmation after payment verified

### 2. Updated Booking Controller
**File:** `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js`

Modified two functions:
- `createBooking()` - Now sends booking success notification after booking creation
- `confirmBooking()` - Now sends confirmation notification when booking status changes from Pending to Confirmed (when isPay=TRUE and totalPaid >= ‚Ç±1,000)

## üìã How It Works

### Step 1: Customer Creates Booking
```
Customer submits booking form
         ‚Üì
System saves booking to database
         ‚Üì
System sends NOTIFICATION #1 (Booking Success)
  üì± SMS: "Your booking is successful! Pay ‚Ç±X within [deadline]"
  üìß Email: Detailed booking info + payment instructions + deadline
```

### Step 2: Customer Makes Payment & System Auto-Confirms
```
Customer pays ‚â• ‚Ç±1,000
         ‚Üì
Admin adds payment via Payment page
         ‚Üì
System checks: Pending status + totalPaid >= ‚Ç±1,000?
         ‚Üì
If YES: Automatically changes status to "Confirmed"
         ‚Üì
System sends NOTIFICATION #2 (Booking Confirmed)
  üì± SMS: "Your booking is CONFIRMED! Pickup: [date]"
  üìß Email: Complete booking details + pickup instructions
```

**Alternative Path:** Admin can also manually confirm by:
- Setting isPay = TRUE
- Clicking "Confirm Booking" button
- This also triggers the confirmation notification

## üîî Notification Content

### Notification #1: Booking Success

**SMS (Short & Direct):**
```
Hi [Name]! Your booking for [Car] is successful! 
To confirm, pay ‚Ç±[Balance] within [Deadline] 
(by [DateTime]). Booking ID: [ID]. - JA Car Rental
```

**Email (Detailed):**
- Booking ID and car details
- Pickup/return dates and locations
- Total amount and amount due
- **Payment deadline** (based on start date)
- Warning about auto-cancellation
- Next steps

### Notification #2: Booking Confirmation

**SMS (Celebratory):**
```
Hi [Name]! Your booking for [Car] is now CONFIRMED! 
Pickup: [DateTime]. Booking ID: [ID]. 
See you soon! - JA Car Rental
```

**Email (Complete Guide):**
- ‚úÖ Confirmed status
- Vehicle details with plate number
- Rental period
- Pickup/return locations
- Payment breakdown (paid amount + remaining balance)
- What to bring (license, ID)
- Next steps for pickup

## ‚è∞ Payment Deadline Rules

| Booking Start Date | Payment Deadline | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| **Today** | 1 hour | Booked 10 AM ‚Üí Pay by 11 AM |
| **Within 3 days** | 24 hours | Booked Mon for Wed ‚Üí Pay by Tue |
| **More than 3 days** | 72 hours (3 days) | Booked Mon for next Mon ‚Üí Pay by Thu |

These rules match the auto-cancellation system.

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

**Non-Blocking Design:**
- If notification fails ‚Üí booking still succeeds
- Errors logged to console
- System continues normal operation
- Customer can still proceed even if notification fails

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Missing phone number ‚Üí Only email sent
- Missing email ‚Üí Only SMS sent
- Both missing ‚Üí Booking succeeds, notification skipped
- API not configured ‚Üí Simulated mode (dev only)

## üß™ Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Same-Day Booking
1. Create booking with start date = today
2. ‚úÖ Check: SMS & email received immediately
3. ‚úÖ Check: Deadline is 1 hour from booking time
4. ‚úÖ Check: Booking status = "Pending"

### Test Scenario 2: Payment & Confirmation
1. Create booking (any start date)
2. Admin adds payment of ‚Ç±1,000+
3. Admin sets isPay = TRUE
4. Admin confirms booking
5. ‚úÖ Check: Status changes to "Confirmed"
6. ‚úÖ Check: Confirmation SMS & email received
7. ‚úÖ Check: Email shows correct balance

### Test Scenario 3: Insufficient Payment
1. Create booking
2. Admin adds payment of ‚Ç±500 (less than ‚Ç±1,000)
3. Admin sets isPay = TRUE
4. Admin confirms booking
5. ‚úÖ Check: Status remains "Pending"
6. ‚úÖ Check: NO confirmation notification sent

## üîß Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
```env
# Required for SMS (Semaphore API)
SEMAPHORE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Required for Email (Gmail)
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password_here
```

**Note:** System works without these (simulated mode) for development.

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Set SEMAPHORE_API_KEY in production environment
- [ ] Set EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS in production environment
- [ ] Test with real phone number and email
- [ ] Verify SMS delivery (check Semaphore dashboard)
- [ ] Verify email delivery (check inbox & spam)
- [ ] Test all three deadline scenarios
- [ ] Test partial payment (< ‚Ç±1,000) does NOT send confirmation
- [ ] Test full payment (‚â• ‚Ç±1,000) sends confirmation
- [ ] Monitor backend logs for any errors

## üí° Key Features
