# Cancellation Approved Notifications System

## Overview
This document describes the cancellation approved notification system that confirms to customers when their booking cancellation requests have been approved by admin/staff.

## When Notifications Are Sent

### **Cancellation Request Approval**
- **Trigger**: When admin/staff approves a cancellation request
- **Location**: `confirmCancellationRequest()` in `bookingController.js`
- **Flow**:
  1. Customer submits cancellation request (sets `isCancel = true`)
  2. Booking appears in admin panel's "CANCELLATION" tab
  3. Admin reviews the cancellation request
  4. Admin clicks "Confirm" button to approve the cancellation
  5. System updates `booking_status` to "Cancelled"
  6. System sends cancellation approved notification to customer
  7. Transaction record is created with cancellation date

## Technical Implementation

### New Function Added: `sendCancellationApprovedNotification()`

**Location**: `backend/src/utils/notificationService.js`

**Parameters**:
- `booking` - Booking object with dates and amounts
- `customer` - Customer object with contact information
- `car` - Car object with vehicle details

**Behavior**:
- Always sends both SMS and Email (dual-channel)
- Non-blocking - failures don't prevent cancellation processing
- Includes original booking details
- Mentions refund process

### Modified Controller

#### **bookingController.js**
```javascript
// Added import
import { sendCancellationApprovedNotification } from "../utils/notificationService.js";

// In confirmCancellationRequest() - After booking status update
const updatedBooking = await prisma.booking.update({
  where: { booking_id: bookingId },
  data: {
    booking_status: "Cancelled",
    isCancel: false,
  },
  include: {
    car: { 
      select: { 
        make: true, 
        model: true, 
        year: true, 
        license_plate: true 
      } 
    },
    customer: { 
      select: { 
        customer_id: true,
        first_name: true, 
        last_name: true,
        email: true,
        contact_no: true
      } 
    }
  },
});

// Send cancellation approved notification
await sendCancellationApprovedNotification(
  updatedBooking,
  customer,
  car
);
```

## Important Notes

### Why Notification on Approval?
- **Customer initiated**: Customer submits request, waits for admin approval
- **Confirmation needed**: Customer should know their request was reviewed and approved
- **Next steps clarity**: Notification explains what happens next (refunds, etc.)
- **Professional service**: Keeps customer informed throughout the process

### Cancellation vs Rejection
- **Approved (this notification)**: Booking cancelled, customer notified, transaction created
- **Rejected**: isCancel set to false, booking remains active (no notification currently)

### Refund Information
The notification mentions refunds because:
- Customer may have already paid (partial or full)
- Refund processing is a separate manual step
- Sets customer expectations (5-7 business days)
- Reduces support queries

### Error Handling
- Notification call is wrapped in try-catch block
- Notification failure is logged but doesn't prevent cancellation
- Uses `console.log` with emojis for easy tracking:
  - üö´ Cancellation notification being sent
  - ‚úÖ Notification sent successfully
  - ‚ùå Notification failed
