# Cancellation Notification System Enhancement

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Purpose:** Add admin notifications for cancellation requests and customer notifications for denied cancellations

---

## üìã Overview

Enhanced the cancellation notification system with two new notification types:
1. **Admin Notification** - When customer requests cancellation (always SMS+Email)
2. **Customer Notification** - When admin denies cancellation request (based on isRecUpdate)

Previously, only cancellation approvals notified customers. Now the complete cancellation workflow has full notification coverage.

---

## üéØ Requirements

**User Request:**
> "can you also add a notification for when there is a booking cancelation request to the admin/staff. and since there is a notification already for when the cancellation is approved in the customer side, add also a notification when the cancellation request is denied (customer side notification will base on the method recorded in isRecUpdate)."

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Admin receives SMS+Email when customer requests cancellation
- ‚úÖ Customer receives SMS/Email (based on preference) when cancellation denied
- ‚úÖ Existing: Customer receives notification when cancellation approved
- ‚úÖ Complete cancellation workflow now has full notification coverage

## üìä Complete Notification Matrix

### Customer-Initiated Actions ‚Üí Notifications

| Customer Action | Customer Gets | Admin Gets |
|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Creates booking | SMS/Email (preference) | SMS + Email |
| Requests cancellation | Nothing (just waits) | **SMS + Email** ‚Üê NEW |

sendSMSNotification(ADMIN_PHONE, smsMessage);
sendEmailNotification(ADMIN_EMAIL, emailSubject, emailBody);
```

### Customer Notifications (Based on isRecUpdate)
```javascript
// Check customer preference
const notifMethod = parseInt(isRecUpdate) || 0;

switch(notifMethod) {
  case 0: // None - No notifications sent
    return;
  case 1: // SMS only
    sendSMSNotification(contact_no, smsMessage);
    break;
  case 2: // Email only
    sendEmailNotification(email, emailSubject, emailBody);
    break;
  case 3: // Both SMS and Email
    sendSMSNotification(contact_no, smsMessage);
    sendEmailNotification(email, emailSubject, emailBody);
    break;
}
```

## üéì Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Admin Always Gets Both**
**Decision:** Admin cancellation request notification sends both SMS and Email  
**Reason:** Critical alerts need multiple delivery channels for reliability

### 2. **Customer Respects Preference**
**Decision:** Cancellation denied notification follows customer's isRecUpdate  
**Reason:** Consistency with existing customer notifications

### 3. **Non-Blocking Implementation**
**Decision:** Notification failures don't prevent cancellation actions  
**Reason:** Business operations must continue even if notifications fail

### 4. **Empathetic Denial Messages**
**Decision:** Denial notifications are professional and helpful  
**Reason:** Maintains good customer relationships even when declining requests

### 5. **Detailed Admin Context**
**Decision:** Admin notification includes cancellation reason and full details  
**Reason:** Helps admin make informed decisions about approval/denial

### 6. **Contact Info in Denial**
**Decision:** Denial email includes business contact information  
**Reason:** Encourages customer to discuss concerns rather than leave negative reviews
