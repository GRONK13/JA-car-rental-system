# CAR STATUS & AUTO-CANCEL UPDATES

## Overview
Implemented three major improvements to the booking system:
1. **Car Status Management**: Cars are marked as "Rented" immediately upon booking to prevent double booking
2. **Edit Booking Modal**: Improved layout to be more centered and mobile-friendly
3. **Auto-Cancel System**: Automated deletion of expired unpaid bookings after 3-day deadline

---

## 1. Car Status to "Rented" on Booking Creation

### Problem
Previously, cars could be double-booked because the car status wasn't updated until payment was confirmed. This allowed multiple customers to book the same car.

### Solution
Car status is now set to "Rented" immediately when a booking is created, regardless of payment status.

### Files Modified

#### `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js`

**In `createBooking` function (after line 353):**
```javascript
// Update car status to 'Rented' immediately to prevent double booking
// This happens regardless of payment status
try {
  await prisma.car.update({
    where: { car_id: parseInt(car_id) },
    data: { car_status: 'Rented' }
  });
  console.log(`Car ${car_id} status updated to 'Rented'`);
} catch (carUpdateError) {
  console.error("Error updating car status:", carUpdateError);
  // Don't fail the booking creation if car status update fails
}
```

**In `deleteBooking` function:**
```javascript
// Get the booking to find the car_id before deleting
const booking = await prisma.booking.findUnique({
  where: { booking_id: bookingId },
  select: { car_id: true }
});

// Delete the booking
await prisma.booking.delete({ where: { booking_id: bookingId } });

// Update car status back to 'Available' after booking is deleted
if (booking?.car_id) {
  try {
    await prisma.car.update({
      where: { car_id: booking.car_id },
      data: { car_status: 'Available' }
    });
    console.log(`Car ${booking.car_id} status updated to 'Available' after booking deletion`);
  } catch (carUpdateError) {
    console.error("Error updating car status after deletion:", carUpdateError);
  }
}
```

**In `cancelBookingByAdmin` function:**
```javascript
// Update car status back to 'Available' when booking is cancelled
try {
  await prisma.car.update({
    where: { car_id: booking.car.car_id },
    data: { car_status: 'Available' }
  });
  console.log(`Car ${booking.car.car_id} status updated to 'Available' after cancellation`);
} catch (carUpdateError) {
  console.error("Error updating car status after cancellation:", carUpdateError);
}
```

### Flow
1. **Customer books car** ‚Üí Car status: `Rented`
2. **Booking deleted/cancelled** ‚Üí Car status: `Available`
3. **Auto-cancel triggers** ‚Üí Car status: `Available`

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ Prevents double booking
- ‚úÖ Protects limited car inventory
- ‚úÖ Consistent car availability tracking
- ‚úÖ Better user experience (no booking conflicts)

---

## 2. Edit Booking Modal Layout Improvements

### Problem
The `NewEditBookingModal` had excessive empty space and wasn't optimized for mobile devices, making it difficult to use on smaller screens.

### Solution
Centered all content within a maximum width container and added responsive padding for better mobile experience.

### Files Modified

#### `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/NewEditBookingModal.jsx`

**Changes Applied:**
1. **Service Type Step**: Centered with 600px max-width container
2. **Booking Details Step**: Centered with 800px max-width container
3. **Confirmation Step**: Centered with 800px max-width container
4. **Dialog Settings**: Changed from `maxWidth="lg"` to `maxWidth="md"`
5. **Responsive Padding**: Added `p: { xs: 2, sm: 3 }` for mobile-first padding
6. **Flexible Height**: Changed from fixed `minHeight: '80vh'` to adaptive `minHeight: { xs: 'auto', sm: '70vh' }`
7. **Button Spacing**: Added `gap: 1` to DialogActions and `minWidth` to buttons

**Example Pattern:**
```jsx
// Before
<Box sx={{ p: 3 }}>
  <Grid container spacing={3}>
    ...
  </Grid>
</Box>

// After
<Box sx={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', p: { xs: 2, sm: 3 } }}>
  <Box sx={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '800px' }}>
    <Grid container spacing={3}>
      ...
    </Grid>
  </Box>
</Box>
```

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ Reduced empty space on large screens
- ‚úÖ Better mobile responsiveness
- ‚úÖ Consistent with other modals (PaymentModal, BookingModal)
- ‚úÖ Improved readability and UX
- ‚úÖ Better button sizing on mobile

## 3. Auto-Cancel System for Expired Unpaid Bookings

### Problem
Bookings that exceeded their 3-day payment deadline were not automatically cancelled, leaving cars in "Rented" status even though customers never paid.

### Solution
Implemented an automated scheduled task that runs every hour to:
1. Find expired unpaid bookings
2. Delete the booking records
3. Reset car status to "Available"
4. Create transaction records for audit trail

### Files Created/Modified

#### NEW: `backend/src/utils/autoCancel.js`
Complete utility file with two main functions:

**`autoCancelExpiredBookings()`** - Main auto-cancel logic
- Finds bookings where:
  - Status = "Pending"
  - `isPay` = false or null (not paid)
  - `payment_deadline` has passed
  - `isCancel` = false (not in cancellation process)
  - Within last 30 days (safety check)
- Deletes booking
- Updates car status to "Available"
- Creates transaction record with cancellation_date
- Returns summary of cancelled bookings

**`manualTriggerAutoCancel(req, res)`** - Manual trigger endpoint
- Allows admin/staff to manually run auto-cancel
- Returns results as JSON response
- Useful for testing and debugging

#### MODIFIED: `backend/src/index.js`
Added scheduler setup on server startup:
```javascript
import { autoCancelExpiredBookings } from "./utils/autoCancel.js";

// Setup auto-cancel scheduler
// Runs every hour to check for expired bookings
const AUTO_CANCEL_INTERVAL = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1 hour

// Run immediately on startup (after 30 seconds)
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Running initial auto-cancel check...');
  autoCancelExpiredBookings();
}, 30000);

// Then run every hour
setInterval(() => {
  console.log('Running scheduled auto-cancel check...');
  autoCancelExpiredBookings();
}, AUTO_CANCEL_INTERVAL);
```

#### NEW: `backend/src/routes/autoCancelRoutes.js`
Manual trigger route for admin/staff:
```javascript
POST /api/auto-cancel/trigger
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Role: Admin or Staff only
```

### How It Works

**Timeline:**
1. **Day 0**: Customer books car ‚Üí Car status: "Rented", `payment_deadline` set
2. **Day 1-3**: Customer can pay before deadline
3. **Day 3**: Payment deadline passes
4. **Next scheduler run (within 1 hour)**: 
   - Auto-cancel detects expired booking
   - Deletes booking record
   - Sets car status to "Available"
   - Creates transaction record

**Scheduler Frequency:**
- Runs every **1 hour** (3,600,000 ms)
- Initial run **30 seconds** after server starts
- Can be manually triggered via API endpoint

### Query Logic
```sql
WHERE 
  booking_status = 'Pending'
  AND (isPay = false OR isPay IS NULL)
  AND payment_deadline < NOW()
  AND isCancel = false
  AND booking_date >= (NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY)
```

### Console Output
```
üîç Checking for expired unpaid bookings...
‚ö†Ô∏è Found 2 expired booking(s). Processing cancellation...
‚úÖ Booking #123 deleted and car 5 set to Available
‚úÖ Booking #124 deleted and car 7 set to Available
‚úÖ Auto-cancel completed: 2 booking(s) cancelled
```

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ Automatic cleanup of expired bookings
- ‚úÖ Frees up car inventory for new customers
- ‚úÖ No manual intervention required
- ‚úÖ Audit trail via transaction records
- ‚úÖ Manual trigger available for testing
- ‚úÖ Safety checks prevent accidental deletions

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Email notifications to customers
- [ ] SMS notifications option
- [ ] Configurable deadline periods
- [ ] Grace period option
- [ ] Dashboard analytics for auto-cancelled bookings

## Testing Guide

### Test 1: Car Status on Booking
1. Create a new booking
2. Check database: `SELECT car_status FROM car WHERE car_id = ?`
3. Expected: `car_status = 'Rented'`

### Test 2: Car Status on Cancellation
1. Cancel a booking (admin or customer)
2. Check database: `SELECT car_status FROM car WHERE car_id = ?`
3. Expected: `car_status = 'Available'`

### Test 3: Edit Booking Modal
1. Open edit booking modal
2. Check on mobile device (responsive testing)
3. Verify content is centered
4. Verify buttons don't overflow
5. Verify proper spacing on all steps

### Test 4: Auto-Cancel System
**Method 1: Wait for natural expiration**
1. Create a booking with near-future payment_deadline
2. Wait for deadline to pass
3. Wait up to 1 hour for scheduler
4. Check booking is deleted and car is available

**Method 2: Manual trigger (faster)**
1. Create a booking with past payment_deadline (manually in DB)
2. Call `POST /api/auto-cancel/trigger` with admin token
3. Check response and verify booking deleted
4. Check car status changed to 'Available'

**Test Query:**
```sql
-- Create test booking with expired deadline
UPDATE booking 
SET payment_deadline = DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR),
    isPay = false,
    booking_status = 'Pending'
WHERE booking_id = ?;

-- Then trigger auto-cancel and verify deletion
```

## API Endpoints

### Manual Auto-Cancel Trigger
```
POST /api/auto-cancel/trigger
Authorization: Bearer <admin_or_staff_token>

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Auto-cancel process completed",
  "cancelled": 2,
  "total": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "booking_id": 123,
      "customer": "John Doe",
      "car": "Toyota Camry",
      "status": "cancelled"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Database Schema

### Booking Table (Relevant Fields)
```prisma
model Booking {
  booking_id       Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  booking_status   String    // "Pending", "Confirmed", "Cancelled", etc.
  payment_deadline DateTime? // Deadline for payment (3 days from booking)
  isPay            Boolean?  // false/null = not paid, true = paid
  isCancel         Boolean   // false = not in cancellation, true = cancellation pending
  booking_date     DateTime  // When booking was created
  car_id           Int
  customer_id      Int
  
  car              Car       @relation(fields: [car_id], references: [car_id])
  customer         Customer  @relation(fields: [customer_id], references: [customer_id])
}
```

### Car Table (Relevant Fields)
```prisma
model Car {
  car_id     Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  car_status String?   // "Available", "Rented", "Maintenance", etc.
  
  bookings   Booking[]
}
```

## Configuration

### Scheduler Interval
Edit in `backend/src/index.js`:
```javascript
const AUTO_CANCEL_INTERVAL = 60 * 60 * 1000; // Change to desired milliseconds
// 30 minutes: 30 * 60 * 1000
// 1 hour: 60 * 60 * 1000
// 6 hours: 6 * 60 * 60 * 1000
```

### Payment Deadline Period
Currently set when booking is created (typically 3 days). To change, edit booking creation logic in `bookingController.js`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Auto-Cancel Not Running
1. Check server console for scheduler initialization logs
2. Verify server has been running for at least 30 seconds
3. Check for any error logs in console

### Car Status Not Updating
1. Check database permissions
2. Verify car_id exists in bookings
3. Check console logs for update errors
4. Ensure Prisma connection is working

### Modal Layout Issues
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check browser console for React errors
3. Verify Material-UI version compatibility
4. Test on different screen sizes
