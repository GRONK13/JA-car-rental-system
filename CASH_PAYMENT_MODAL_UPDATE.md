# Cash Payment Modal Update

## Overview
Modified the **PaymentModal** component to improve the cash payment flow. When a customer selects "Cash" as the payment method, the second step now displays instructions to visit the office instead of asking for amount input.

## Changes Made

### File Modified
`frontend/src/ui/components/modal/PaymentModal.jsx`

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Step 2: Payment Details - New Cash Payment Flow**

**Before:**
- Cash payments showed an amount input field
- Customer had to manually enter the payment amount
- Small instruction text below

**After:**
- Cash payments now show a prominent instruction card
- No amount input field (amount is automatically set to full remaining balance)
- Displays comprehensive office visit instructions

### 2. **Automatic Amount Setting**

When a customer selects "Cash" payment method and clicks "Next" from Step 1:
```javascript
// In handleNext() function
if (paymentData.payment_method === 'Cash') {
  setPaymentData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    amount: getRemainingBalance().toString()
  }));
}
```

The full remaining balance is automatically set as the payment amount.

### 3. **Validation Updates**

**Cash Payment Validation:**
```javascript
// In validatePaymentDetails() function
if (paymentData.payment_method === 'Cash') {
  return true; // Cash payments just show instructions, always valid
}
```

Cash payments skip amount validation since there's no user input required.

**GCash Payment Validation:**
- Still validates amount input
- Still validates GCash number format (09XXXXXXXXX)
- Still validates reference number presence

### 4. **UI Components**

The new Cash payment instructions display includes:

- **üìç Office Location**
  - JA Car Rental Office address

- **üïê Business Hours**
  - Weekday and weekend hours
  - Closed on Sundays

- **üí∞ Amount Due**
  - Displays the full remaining balance
  - Formatted with thousand separators

- **üìù What to Bring**
  - Booking ID
  - Valid ID
  - Cash payment

- **‚è≥ Important Notice**
  - Booking remains pending until staff verification

### 5. **User Experience Flow**

#### Cash Payment Journey:
1. **Step 1**: Select "Cash" payment method
2. **Step 2**: See instructions to visit office (no input required)
3. **Step 3**: Review confirmation details
4. **Submit**: Creates payment record in pending state

#### GCash Payment Journey:
1. **Step 1**: Select "GCash" payment method  
2. **Step 2**: Enter amount, GCash number, and reference number
3. **Step 3**: Review confirmation details
4. **Submit**: Creates payment record in pending state

### 6. **Step 3: Confirmation (Unchanged)**

The confirmation step remains the same for both payment methods:
- Shows payment summary
- Displays booking details
- Shows vehicle information
- Confirms payment amount and method

## Technical Notes

### Component Structure
- **Step 0**: Payment Method Selection (GCash or Cash)
- **Step 1**: Payment Details (conditional rendering based on method)
- **Step 2**: Confirmation Review

### State Management
```javascript
const [paymentData, setPaymentData] = useState({
  payment_method: '',
  gcash_no: '',
  reference_no: '',
  amount: ''  // Auto-set for Cash, user input for GCash
});
```

### Backend Integration
No backend changes required. The payment controller already handles:
- Cash payments with pending status
- Setting `is_cash_payment: true` flag
- Appropriate response messages

## Benefits

1. **Clearer User Experience**
   - Cash payers immediately see what to do
   - No confusion about amount entry
   - Office location and hours clearly displayed

2. **Reduced Errors**
   - No incorrect amount entries for cash payments
   - Automatic full balance payment for cash
   - Clear instructions prevent user mistakes

3. **Consistent with Business Flow**
   - Cash payments require office visit
   - Staff verification at office
   - Full payment expected for cash method

4. **Better Mobile Experience**
   - Large, readable instruction card
   - Icon-based visual hierarchy
   - Warning color scheme for important info
