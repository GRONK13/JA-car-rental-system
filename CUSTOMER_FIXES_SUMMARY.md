## ‚úÖ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **"Join Waitlist" ‚Üí "Notify me when available"**
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerCars.jsx`

- **Location**: Line 787
- **Purpose**: More user-friendly language for waitlist feature

### 2. **Under Maintenance Cars - Non-clickable**

- **Location**: Lines 690-707
- **Purpose**: Prevent customers from attempting to book cars under maintenance

### 3. **Booking Time Restrictions (7 AM - 7 PM)**
- **File**: `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/BookingModal.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added validation for pickup time (must be between 07:00 and 19:00)
  - Added validation for dropoff time (must be between 07:00 and 19:00)
  - Added validation: dropoff time must be after pickup time
  - Error messages display when times are outside office hours
- **Location**: Lines 309-360 (in `validateForm` function)
- **Purpose**: Ensure all bookings are within office/booking hours

### 4. **Same-Day Booking 3-Hour Gap**
- **File**: `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/BookingModal.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added validation for same-day bookings
  - Checks if booking date equals pickup date
  - Enforces 3-hour minimum gap between booking time and pickup time
  - Example: Book at 1:00 PM ‚Üí earliest pickup is 4:00 PM
  - Displays earliest available pickup time in error message
- **Location**: Lines 367-386 (in `validateForm` function)
- **Purpose**: Provide sufficient time for booking preparation and vehicle availability

### 5. **Auto-Cancel Feature (3 Days)**
- **Files**: 
  - `backend/src/utils/autoCancel.js` (already implemented)
  - `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/BookingModal.jsx` (payment deadline updated)

  - Simplified `calculatePaymentDeadline` function to use consistent 72-hour deadline
  - Updated `formatPaymentDeadline` message to clearly state auto-cancel policy
  - Auto-cancel backend runs **every hour** to check for expired unpaid bookings
- **How it works**:
  1. Customer creates booking ‚Üí payment deadline set to 72 hours from booking time
  2. Hourly scheduler checks for bookings with `payment_deadline < now` AND `isPay = false`
  3. Expired bookings are deleted from database
  4. Car status is reset to "Available"
  5. Transaction record is created for audit trail
- **Location**: 
  - Frontend: Lines 434-442, 455-463
  - Backend: `autoCancel.js` (complete implementation)
- **Purpose**: Automatically free up cars from unpaid bookings after 3 days

## üìù Notes

1. **Auto-Cancel Verification**: The auto-cancel feature is already fully implemented and running. It checks every hour for expired bookings.

2. **Time Zone**: All times use server's local time zone. Ensure server time is correctly configured.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If a customer books exactly at 4:00 PM for today, earliest pickup is 7:00 PM (within office hours)
   - If calculated minimum pickup time exceeds 7:00 PM, the system will enforce the 7:00 PM limit but still show error

4. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Email notifications for auto-cancelled bookings
   - SMS alerts for payment reminders
   - Grace period for customers close to deadline

- No database migrations required
