# Customer Side Fixes - Implementation Documentation

## Date: January 2025

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive fixes applied to the customer-side functionality including pending approval workflows for cancellations, extensions, payments, and settlement handling.

---

## ~~1. Philippine Timezone Implementation~~ (REVERTED)

**Note:** This feature was reverted as pickup_time and dropoff_time are working correctly. The booking_date field already captures the current date/time properly using `new Date()`.

---

## 1. ‚úÖ Pending Cancellation Workflow

### Problem
Customer cancellations were immediately processed without admin approval.

### Solution
Implemented `isCancel` flag system where cancellation requests require admin confirmation.

### Files Modified
- `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js` - cancelBooking function
- `frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerBookings.jsx` - Cancel handling

### Implementation Details

**Backend Changes:**
```javascript
// Set isCancel flag without changing booking_status
const updatedBooking = await prisma.booking.update({
  where: { booking_id: bookingId },
  data: {
    isCancel: true,
    // booking_status remains unchanged until admin confirms
  },
});

res.json({
  success: true,
  message: `Cancellation request submitted. Waiting for admin confirmation.`,
  booking: updatedBooking,
  pending_approval: true,
});
```

**Frontend Changes:**
```javascript
// Show pending approval message
const message = result.pending_approval 
  ? `‚úÖ Cancellation request submitted! Your booking is pending admin approval.`
  : `‚úÖ ${result.message}`;

// Disable cancel button if isCancel is true
{!booking.isCancel && (
  <Button onClick={() => handleCancel()}>Cancel</Button>
)}

// Show pending indicator
{booking.isCancel && (
  <Box sx={{ backgroundColor: '#fff3cd' }}>
    ‚è≥ Cancellation request pending admin approval
  </Box>
)}
```

---

## 2. ‚úÖ Payment Button Visibility (isPay Flag)

### Problem
After a customer makes a payment, the Pay Now button was still visible, potentially allowing duplicate payments.

### Solution
Hide the Pay Now button when `isPay = true` to prevent duplicate payment submissions.

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerBookings.jsx` - Pay Now button logic

### Implementation Details

**Frontend Changes:**
```javascript
{/* Pay Now Button - Only show if balance > 0 and isPay is false */}
{booking.balance > 0 && 
 !booking.isPay &&
 booking.booking_status?.toLowerCase() !== 'cancelled' && 
 booking.booking_status?.toLowerCase() !== 'completed' && (
  <Button onClick={() => handlePayNow()}>Pay Now</Button>
)}

// Show pending payment indicator when isPay is true but not yet confirmed
{booking.isPay && booking.payment_status?.toLowerCase() !== 'paid' && (
  <Box sx={{ backgroundColor: '#fff3cd' }}>
    ‚è≥ Payment submitted - waiting for verification
  </Box>
)}
```

**Logic:**
- `isPay = false` ‚Üí Show "Pay Now" button (customer hasn't paid yet)
- `isPay = true` ‚Üí Hide "Pay Now" button (payment submitted, awaiting admin confirmation)
- `payment_status = 'Paid'` ‚Üí Payment verified by admin, no button needed

This prevents customers from making duplicate payments while their initial payment is being verified by admin/staff.

---

## 3. ‚úÖ Pending Cancellation Workflow

### Problem
Extension requests were immediately processed without admin approval.

### Solution
Implemented `isExtend` flag system where extension requests require admin confirmation.

### Files Modified
- `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js` - extendMyBooking function
- `frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerBookings.jsx` - Extend handling

### Implementation Details

**Backend Changes:**
```javascript
// Set isExtend flag and store new_end_date without updating end_date
const updatedBooking = await prisma.booking.update({
  where: { booking_id: bookingId },
  data: {
    isExtend: true,
    new_end_date: newEndDate,
    // end_date and total_amount remain unchanged until admin confirms
  },
});

res.json({
  success: true,
  message: `Extension request for ${additionalDays} days submitted. Waiting for admin confirmation.`,
  additional_cost: additionalCost,
  new_total: newTotalAmount,
  pending_approval: true,
});
```

**Frontend Changes:**
```javascript
// Disable extend button if isExtend is true
{!booking.isExtend && (
  <Button onClick={() => handleExtend()}>Extend</Button>
)}

// Show pending indicator
{booking.isExtend && (
  <Box sx={{ backgroundColor: '#fff3cd' }}>
    ‚è≥ Extension request pending admin approval
  </Box>
)}
```

---

## 4. ‚úÖ Pending Extension Workflow

### Problem
Payments were automatically marking bookings as paid/confirmed without admin verification.

### Solution
All customer payments (Cash and GCash) now require admin confirmation before updating booking status.

### Files Modified
- `backend/src/controllers/paymentController.js` - processBookingPayment function
- `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/PaymentModal.jsx` - Payment confirmation messages

### Implementation Details

**Backend Changes:**
```javascript
// Create payment record without updating booking status
const payment = await prisma.payment.create({
  data: {
    booking_id: parseInt(booking_id),
    customer_id: parseInt(customerId),
    amount: parseInt(amount),
    paid_date: getPhilippineTime(),
    balance: Math.max(0, (booking.total_amount || 0) - parseInt(amount)),
  },
});

// DO NOT update booking.isPay or booking.payment_status
// Wait for admin to confirm payment

const paymentMessage = payment_method.toLowerCase() === 'cash' 
  ? `Cash payment request submitted. Please visit our office to complete the payment.`
  : `Payment request submitted. Your booking will be confirmed once the admin verifies your payment.`;

res.json({
  message: paymentMessage,
  pending_admin_confirmation: true,
  is_cash_payment: payment_method.toLowerCase() === 'cash',
});
```

**Frontend Changes:**
```javascript
if (result.pending_admin_confirmation) {
  const message = result.is_cash_payment
    ? `‚úÖ ${result.message}\n\nüìç Please visit our office to complete your cash payment.\n\n‚è≥ Your booking status will remain pending until verified.`
    : `‚úÖ ${result.message}\n\n‚è≥ Your booking status will remain pending until verified.`;
  alert(message);
}
```

## 5. ‚úÖ Pending Payment Confirmation

### Problem
Cash payments needed special handling to prompt customers to visit office.

### Solution
Cash payments now show specific instructions and set status to pending.

### Files Modified
- `backend/src/controllers/paymentController.js`
- `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/PaymentModal.jsx`

### Implementation Details

**Special Cash Payment Message:**
```javascript
// Backend
const isCashPayment = payment_method.toLowerCase() === 'cash';
const message = isCashPayment
  ? `Cash payment request submitted. Please visit our office to complete the payment. Your booking will be confirmed once the admin verifies your payment.`
  : `Payment request submitted. Your booking will be confirmed once the admin verifies your payment.`;

// Frontend
if (result.is_cash_payment) {
  alert(`‚úÖ ${result.message}\n\nüìç Please visit our office:\nJA Car Rental Office\n\n‚è≥ Your booking remains pending until payment is verified by our staff.`);
}
```

---

## 6. ‚úÖ Cash Payment Special Flow

### Problem
Cancelled bookings were still showing in unpaid settlements section.

### Solution
Filter out cancelled bookings from unpaid settlements display.

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerDashboard.jsx`

### Implementation Details

```javascript
// Filter unpaid settlements excluding cancelled bookings
const unpaidSettlements = bookings.filter(booking =>
  (booking.payment_status?.toLowerCase() === 'unpaid' ||
  booking.payment_status?.toLowerCase() === 'pending' ||
  !booking.payment_status) &&
  booking.booking_status?.toLowerCase() !== 'cancelled' // Exclude cancelled
);
```

---

## 7. ‚úÖ Dashboard - Remove Unpaid Settlements for Cancelled Bookings

### Problem
Cancelled bookings were not visible or properly labeled in schedule page.

### Solution
Added status column to schedule table showing all booking statuses including "Cancelled".

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/ui/components/table/CustomerScheduleTable.jsx`

### Implementation Details

```javascript
// Add booking_status to normalized rows
booking_status: r.booking_status ?? 'N/A',

// Add status column with colored chips
{
  field: 'booking_status',
  headerName: 'Status',
  flex: 0.75,
  minWidth: 120,
  renderCell: (params) => {
    const status = params?.row?.booking_status || 'N/A';
    const getStatusColor = () => {
      const lowerStatus = status.toLowerCase();
      if (lowerStatus === 'cancelled') return 'error';
      if (lowerStatus === 'confirmed') return 'success';
      if (lowerStatus === 'pending') return 'warning';
      if (lowerStatus === 'in progress') return 'info';
      return 'default';
    };
    
    return (
      <Chip 
        label={status} 
        color={getStatusColor()} 
        size="small" 
      />
    );
  },
}
```

---

## 8. ‚úÖ Schedule Page - Show Cancelled Bookings

### Problem
Customers couldn't easily see which bookings had pending approval requests.

### Solution
Added visual indicators on booking cards showing pending cancellation/extension status.

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerBookings.jsx`

### Implementation Details

```javascript
{/* Pending Approval Indicators */}
{(booking.isCancel || booking.isExtend || (booking.isPay && booking.payment_status?.toLowerCase() !== 'paid')) && (
  <Box sx={{ 
    mb: 2, 
    p: 1.5, 
    backgroundColor: '#fff3cd', 
    borderRadius: 1, 
    border: '1px solid #ffc107' 
  }}>
    <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#856404' }}>
      ‚è≥ Pending Admin Approval
    </Typography>
    {booking.isCancel && (
      <Typography variant="caption" sx={{ color: '#856404' }}>
        ‚Ä¢ Cancellation request submitted
      </Typography>
    )}
    {booking.isExtend && (
      <Typography variant="caption" sx={{ color: '#856404' }}>
        ‚Ä¢ Extension request submitted
      </Typography>
    )}
    {booking.isPay && booking.payment_status?.toLowerCase() !== 'paid' && (
      <Typography variant="caption" sx={{ color: '#856404' }}>
        ‚Ä¢ Payment submitted - waiting for verification
      </Typography>
    )}
  </Box>
)}
```
