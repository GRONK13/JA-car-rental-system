# Default Notification Settings - Quick Summary

## ✅ Change Complete

All new customer accounts now have **both SMS and Email notifications enabled by default** (`isRecUpdate = 3`).

## 📝 What Changed

### Files Modified (3)
1. **authController.js** - `register()` function
2. **registrationController.js** - `registerUser()` function  
3. **customerController.js** - `createCustomer()` function (admin)

### Code Added
```javascript
isRecUpdate: 3, // Enable both SMS and Email notifications by default
```

## 🎯 Impact

### Before
- New customers: `isRecUpdate` was `NULL` or `0` (no notifications)
- Customers had to manually enable notifications in settings
- Risk of missing important updates

### After ✅
- New customers: `isRecUpdate = 3` (both SMS and Email)
- Notifications work immediately upon registration
- Customers can still change preference in settings anytime

## 📱 Notifications New Customers Will Receive

1. ✅ **Booking Success** - When they create a booking
2. ✅ **Payment Received** - When payment is recorded/approved
3. ✅ **Booking Confirmation** - When booking is confirmed (≥ ₱1,000 paid)
4. ✅ **Cancellation Approved** - When cancellation is approved
5. ✅ **Car Availability** - When interested car becomes available

All notifications sent via **SMS + Email** by default!

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Test
1. Register a new customer account
2. Create a booking with that account
3. ✅ Verify customer receives both SMS and Email for booking success

### Verify Setting is Changeable
1. Log in as customer
2. Go to settings → Change notification preference
3. Create another booking
4. ✅ Verify notification sent via new preference only

## 🚀 Deployment
