# Default Notification Settings for New Customers

## Overview
All new customer accounts now have notifications enabled by default (both SMS and Email). Customers can modify this preference in their settings if they wish.

## Change Summary

### What Was Changed
Set `isRecUpdate = 3` when creating new customer accounts.

### Notification Preference Values
- `0` = No notifications
- `1` = SMS only
- `2` = Email only  
- `3` = Both SMS and Email ✅ **NEW DEFAULT**

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/src/controllers/authController.js`
**Function**: `register()`  
**Usage**: Customer self-registration

```javascript
const customer = await prisma.customer.create({
  data: {
    // ... other fields
    isRecUpdate: 3, // Enable both SMS and Email notifications by default
  },
});
```

### 2. `backend/src/controllers/registrationController.js`
**Function**: `registerUser()`  
**Usage**: Alternative registration endpoint

```javascript
const customer = await prisma.customer.create({
  data: {
    // ... other fields
    isRecUpdate: 3 // Enable both SMS and Email notifications by default
  }
});
```

### 3. `backend/src/controllers/customerController.js`
**Function**: `createCustomer()`  
**Usage**: Admin creating customer accounts

```javascript
const newCustomer = await prisma.customer.create({
  data: {
    // ... other fields
    isRecUpdate: 3, // Enable both SMS and Email notifications by default
  },
});
```

## Behavior

### New Customer Registration
When a customer registers:
1. Account is created with `isRecUpdate = 3`
2. Customer will receive notifications via **both SMS and Email**
3. Applies to all notification types:
   - Booking success
   - Payment received
   - Booking confirmation
   - Cancellation approved
   - Car availability updates

### Customer Can Change Preference
- Customers can modify their notification preference in account settings
- Options available: None, SMS only, Email only, or Both
- Change takes effect immediately for future notifications

## Benefits

### For Customers
✅ **Never miss important updates** - Notifications enabled by default  
✅ **Full flexibility** - Can disable or change preference anytime  
✅ **Best experience** - Get timely updates about bookings and payments  
✅ **No setup needed** - Works immediately after registration

### For Business
✅ **Better communication** - Reach customers effectively from day one  
✅ **Reduced missed notifications** - No "I didn't know" situations  
✅ **Professional service** - Proactive communication standard  
✅ **Customer satisfaction** - Customers stay informed automatically

## Notification Types Affected

With `isRecUpdate = 3`, new customers will automatically receive:

1. **Booking Success Notifications** (SMS + Email)
   - When they create a booking
   
2. **Payment Received Notifications** (SMS + Email)
   - When their payment is recorded/approved
   
3. **Booking Confirmation Notifications** (SMS + Email)
   - When their booking is confirmed
   
4. **Cancellation Approved Notifications** (SMS + Email)
   - When their cancellation is approved
   
5. **Car Availability Notifications** (SMS + Email)
   - When a car they're interested in becomes available

## Testing

### Test New Registration
1. Register a new customer account
2. Check database: `isRecUpdate` should be `3`
3. Create a booking with that account
4. Verify customer receives both SMS and Email notifications

### Verify Setting Can Be Changed
1. Log in as the new customer
2. Go to account settings
3. Change notification preference (e.g., to "SMS only")
4. Create a booking
5. Verify only SMS is sent (not email)

## Database Query to Verify

Check existing customers:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, contact_no, isRecUpdate 
FROM Customer 
ORDER BY date_created DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

New customers should show `isRecUpdate = 3`.

## Migration for Existing Customers

If you want to update existing customers to enable notifications:

```sql
-- Update all customers to enable both notifications
UPDATE Customer 
SET isRecUpdate = 3 
WHERE isRecUpdate IS NULL OR isRecUpdate = 0;
```

**Note**: This is optional. The change only affects NEW registrations going forward.

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to revert to no default notifications:

Simply change `isRecUpdate: 3` to `isRecUpdate: 0` (or remove the field to use database default) in the three controller files.

## Implementation Notes

### Why Default to "Both"?
1. **Maximum reach**: Ensures customers don't miss critical updates
2. **Redundancy**: If one channel fails, the other still works
3. **Customer preference**: Most customers prefer being notified
4. **Easy opt-out**: Customers can change it if they want
5. **Industry standard**: Most booking systems enable notifications by default

### Privacy Consideration
- Customers are informed during registration about notifications
- Easy access to settings to modify preferences
- Clear opt-out process available
- No spam - only transactional notifications sent
