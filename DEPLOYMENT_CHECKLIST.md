## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Backend Deployment

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies (if any new packages)
npm install

# Run database check
npx prisma validate

# No migrations needed (isRecUpdate field already exists)

# Restart backend server
npm run dev
# OR for production:
npm start
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Check logs for any warnings
- [ ] Test health endpoint

---

### Step 2: Frontend Deployment

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (if any new packages)
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start development server (for testing)
npm run dev
# OR deploy build to hosting
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] No build warnings
- [ ] All components load

---

### Step 3: API Endpoint Testing

Use Postman/Thunder Client to test:

#### Test 1: Get Current Customer
```http
GET http://localhost:3000/api/customers/me
Authorization: Bearer <valid-customer-token>

Expected: 200 OK
{
  "customer_id": 1,
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "isRecUpdate": "0",
  ...
}
```

#### Test 2: Update Notification Settings
```http
PUT http://localhost:3000/api/customers/me/notification-settings
Authorization: Bearer <valid-customer-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "isRecUpdate": "3"
}

Expected: 200 OK
{
  "message": "Notification settings updated successfully",
  "customer": { ... }
}
```

#### Test 3: Join Waitlist (Simplified)
```http
POST http://localhost:3000/api/cars/1/waitlist
Authorization: Bearer <valid-customer-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{}

Expected: 201 Created
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "You are position #1...",
  "waitlist_entry": { ... }
}
```

**Results:**
- [ ] All endpoints return expected responses
- [ ] Authentication working correctly
- [ ] Database updates persist

---

### Step 4: Frontend Manual Testing

#### Test Scenario 1: Notification Settings (isRecUpdate = '0')
1. [ ] Log in as customer with isRecUpdate = '0'
2. [ ] Navigate to Cars page
3. [ ] Find a rented car
4. [ ] Click "Notify me when available" button
5. [ ] **Expect:** NotificationSettingsModal opens
6. [ ] Select "SMS only" (value = '1')
7. [ ] Click "Save & Continue"
8. [ ] **Expect:** Modal closes, success snackbar appears
9. [ ] **Verify:** Database shows isRecUpdate = '1'
10. [ ] **Verify:** Waitlist entry created

#### Test Scenario 2: Direct Waitlist Join (isRecUpdate = '1', '2', or '3')
1. [ ] Log in as customer with isRecUpdate = '1'
2. [ ] Navigate to Cars page
3. [ ] Find a rented car
4. [ ] Click "Notify me when available" button
5. [ ] **Expect:** No modal, direct join
6. [ ] **Expect:** Success snackbar: "Successfully joined waitlist!"
7. [ ] **Verify:** Waitlist entry created in database

#### Test Scenario 3: Edit Booking - Service Type Change
1. [ ] Log in as customer with existing booking
2. [ ] Navigate to Bookings page
3. [ ] Click "Edit" on a booking
4. [ ] **Expect:** Modal opens at Step 0 (Service Type)
5. [ ] Change from "Delivery" to "Office Pickup"
6. [ ] Click "Next"
7. [ ] **Expect:** Step 1 shows office pickup fields
8. [ ] Fill/edit details
9. [ ] Click "Next" â†’ Step 2 Confirmation
10. [ ] **Verify:** Service type change shown
11. [ ] Click "Update Booking"
12. [ ] **Expect:** Success, booking updated
13. [ ] **Verify:** Database shows new service type

#### Test Scenario 4: Time Validation
1. [ ] Open edit booking modal
2. [ ] Try pickup time = 6:30 AM
3. [ ] **Expect:** Error "Pickup time must be between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM"
4. [ ] Try dropoff time = 8:30 PM
5. [ ] **Expect:** Error "Drop-off time must be between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM"
6. [ ] Set pickup = 10:00 AM, dropoff = 9:00 AM
7. [ ] **Expect:** Error "Drop-off time must be after pickup time"

#### Test Scenario 5: Same-Day Booking Gap
1. [ ] Current time = 2:00 PM
2. [ ] Open edit booking modal
3. [ ] Change start date to today
4. [ ] Set pickup time = 3:30 PM
5. [ ] **Expect:** Error "Same-day booking requires at least 3 hours notice. Earliest pickup time: 5:00 PM"
6. [ ] Change pickup to 5:00 PM
7. [ ] **Expect:** Validation passes

#### Test Scenario 6: Mobile Responsiveness
1. [ ] Open Chrome DevTools

5. [ ] Test edit booking modal
6. [ ] **Expect:** Step indicator readable, fields not cut off
7. [ ] Test on various screen sizes
8. [ ] **Expect:** All content fits properly

---

### Step 5: Database Verification

```sql
-- Check customer notification settings
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, isRecUpdate 
FROM Customer 
WHERE customer_id = 1;

-- Expected: isRecUpdate should be '0', '1', '2', or '3'

-- Check waitlist entries
SELECT w.waitlist_id, w.customer_id, w.car_id, w.position, w.status,
       c.first_name, c.last_name, c.isRecUpdate
FROM Waitlist w
JOIN Customer c ON w.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE w.status = 'waiting'
ORDER BY w.car_id, w.position;

-- Expected: All waitlist customers should have isRecUpdate != '0'
```

**Results:**
- [ ] isRecUpdate values are valid ('0', '1', '2', '3')
- [ ] Waitlist entries created correctly
- [ ] No orphaned records
- [ ] Foreign keys intact

---

### Step 6: Error Handling Tests

#### Test 1: Already on Waitlist
1. [ ] Join waitlist for car #1
2. [ ] Try to join again for same car
3. [ ] **Expect:** Error "You are already on the waitlist for this car"

#### Test 2: Unauthenticated Request
1. [ ] Remove auth token
2. [ ] Try GET /api/customers/me
3. [ ] **Expect:** 401 Unauthorized

#### Test 3: Invalid isRecUpdate Value
1. [ ] Try PUT with isRecUpdate = '5'
2. [ ] **Expect:** 400 Bad Request with validation message

#### Test 4: Under Maintenance Car
1. [ ] Try to join waitlist for car with status "Under Maintenance"
2. [ ] **Expect:** Error or disabled button

---

### Step 7: Performance Testing

```bash
# Test concurrent requests
# Use Apache Bench or similar tool

ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost:3000/api/customers/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

**Check:**
- [ ] Response time < 500ms
- [ ] No database connection errors
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Server remains stable

---

### Step 8: Security Audit

- [ ] **Authentication:** All protected endpoints require valid token
- [ ] **Authorization:** Customers can only access their own data
- [ ] **SQL Injection:** Prisma ORM prevents SQL injection
- [ ] **XSS:** React auto-escapes user input
- [ ] **CSRF:** Token-based auth prevents CSRF
- [ ] **Sensitive Data:** Password never returned in API responses
- [ ] **Input Validation:** isRecUpdate values validated on backend

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

### Backend Rollback
```bash
# Revert controller changes
git checkout HEAD~1 backend/src/controllers/customerController.js
git checkout HEAD~1 backend/src/routes/customerRoute.js
git checkout HEAD~1 backend/src/controllers/waitlistController.js

# Restart server
npm restart
```

### Frontend Rollback
```bash
# Revert component changes
git checkout HEAD~1 frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerCars.jsx
git checkout HEAD~1 frontend/src/ui/components/modal/NewEditBookingModal.jsx
rm frontend/src/ui/components/modal/NotificationSettingsModal.jsx

# Rebuild
npm run build
```
