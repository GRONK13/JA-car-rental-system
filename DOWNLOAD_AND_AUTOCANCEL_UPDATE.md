### 3. PDF Export Data Accuracy Fixes
**File:** `frontend/src/utils/pdfExport.js`

**Problems Fixed:**

1. **TRANSACTIONS Tab:**
   - ❌ Was showing: startDate, endDate, totalAmount, status (not in data)
   - ✅ Now shows: Transaction ID, Completion Date, Cancellation Date
   - Field mappings updated for both camelCase and snake_case

2. **PAYMENT Tab:**
   - ❌ Was showing: `± 0.00` for amounts
   - ✅ Now correctly maps: `totalAmount` OR `amount` fields
   - ✅ Fixed: `paidDate` (was `paymentDate`)
   - ✅ Fixed date formatting (was DateTime, now Date only)

3. **REFUND Tab:**
   - ❌ Was showing: `± 0.00` for amounts
   - ✅ Now correctly maps: `refundAmount` field
   - ✅ Fixed date formatting

4. **Total Calculations:**
   - ❌ Was summing wrong field (`row.amount`)
   - ✅ Now sums correct field (`row.totalAmount` for payments, `row.refundAmount` for refunds)

**Field Mapping Strategy:**
```javascript
// Supports both frontend (camelCase) and backend (snake_case)
amount: formatCurrency(row.totalAmount || row.amount)
paidDate: formatDate(row.paidDate || row.paid_date)
```

---

### 4. Dynamic Payment Deadline Logic
**File:** `backend/src/utils/autoCancel.js`

**Previous System:**
- ❌ Fixed 72-hour (3-day) deadline for all bookings
- No consideration for booking urgency

**New System:**
Payment deadline based on booking start date proximity:

| Booking Start Date | Payment Deadline | Use Case |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| **TODAY** | **1 hour** from booking time | Same-day urgent bookings |
| **Within 3 days** (not today) | **24 hours** from booking time | Near-future bookings |
| **More than 3 days** | **72 hours** (3 days) from booking time | Standard advance bookings |

**Logic Flow:**
```javascript
1. Get all Pending bookings with unpaid status
2. For each booking:
   a. Calculate days until start_date
   b. Determine deadline:
      - If start is TODAY → deadline = booking_date + 1 hour
      - If start is 1-3 days → deadline = booking_date + 24 hours
      - If start is 4+ days → deadline = booking_date + 72 hours
   c. If NOW > deadline → mark as expired
3. Auto-cancel expired bookings
4. Set car status back to 'Available'
5. Create cancellation transaction record
```

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Fast turnaround for last-minute bookings
- ⏰ Reasonable time for advance bookings
- 🚗 Frees up cars faster for urgent requests
- 📊 Better inventory management

**Console Logging:**
```bash
🔍 Checking 5 pending booking(s) for expiration...
⏰ Booking #123 expired (1 hour deadline - same-day booking)
⏰ Booking #124 expired (24 hour deadline - within 3 days)
⚠️ Found 2 expired booking(s). Processing cancellation...
✅ Booking #123 deleted and car 5 set to Available
✅ Booking #124 deleted and car 7 set to Available
```
