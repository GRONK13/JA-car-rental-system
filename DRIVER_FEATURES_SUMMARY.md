## Technical Highlights

### ✅ Non-Blocking Design
All driver operations wrapped in try-catch blocks - failures don't block booking operations

### ✅ Conditional Logic
Updates and notifications only happen when driver is assigned

### ✅ SMS-Only Communication
Drivers receive SMS notifications only (immediate, mobile-friendly)

### ✅ Philippine Timezone
All dates formatted using `formatDatePH()` helper

### ✅ Privacy-Conscious
Payment amounts excluded from driver notifications

### ✅ Comprehensive Logging
All operations logged with success/failure status

---

## Testing Scenarios Covered

✅ Booking with driver → Status 1 + SMS sent  
✅ Booking without driver → No status update, no SMS  
✅ Payment confirmation → Status 2 + SMS sent  
✅ Payment insufficient → Status stays 1, no SMS  
✅ Car release → Status 3, no SMS  
✅ Car return → Status 0, no SMS  
✅ Booking cancelled → Status 0, no SMS  
✅ Driver without phone → No SMS, operation continues  
✅ SMS service failure → Error logged, operation continues
