# Email Notification Service - Setup Complete ‚úÖ

## Date: October 16, 2025

## Summary
The email notification service has been implemented using **Nodemailer** with Gmail SMTP. The system now sends actual emails when cars become available.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Package Installed**
```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

### 2. **Email Service Updated**
File: `backend/src/utils/notificationService.js`

**Changes:**
- Imported `nodemailer` package
- Implemented actual email sending in `sendEmailNotification()` function
- Uses Gmail SMTP with App Password authentication
- Sends HTML-formatted emails with proper styling
- Falls back to simulated mode if credentials not configured

### 3. **Email Configuration** (Already in `.env`)
```env
EMAIL_USER=gregg.marayan@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=bgjs ttcr zvwm qnvj  # Gmail App Password
```

---

## How It Works

### **Notification Flow:**

1. **Customer Subscribes to Waitlist**
   ```
   POST /api/cars/7/waitlist
   ‚Üí Creates: { customer_id: 10, car_id: 7, status: 'waiting' }
   ```

2. **Admin Changes Car Status to "Available"**
   ```
   PUT /api/cars/7 { car_status: 'Available' }
   ‚Üí Triggers: notifyWaitlistOnCarAvailable(7)
   ```

3. **System Sends Notifications Based on isRecUpdate:**
   - **0**: No notification (skipped)
   - **1**: SMS only (simulated - needs Semaphore API activation)
   - **2**: Email only (‚úÖ WORKING - sends real email via Gmail)
   - **3**: Both SMS and Email (Email works, SMS simulated)

4. **Email Sent Successfully**
   ```
   From: "JA Car Rental" <gregg.marayan@gmail.com>
   To: customer@email.com
   Subject: Car Available: Ford Granger (2026)
   
   Hi Customer,
   
   Great news! The Ford Granger (2026) you were interested in is now available for booking.
   
   Visit our website to book this car now.
   ...
   ```

5. **Database Updated**
   ```
   Waitlist entry updated:
   - status: 'notified'
   - notified_date: current timestamp
   - notification_method: 'Email' or 'Both'
   - notification_success: true
   ```

---

## Email Template

The system sends a beautifully formatted HTML email with:

- **Subject**: `Car Available: [Make] [Model] ([Year])`
- **From**: `"JA Car Rental" <gregg.marayan@gmail.com>`
- **Content**:
  - Personal greeting with customer first name
  - Car details (make, model, year)
  - Call to action to book the car
  - Professional footer with company branding

**Example:**
```
Subject: Car Available: Ford Granger (2026)

## Testing Instructions

### **Test Email Notification (isRecUpdate = 2 or 3):**

1. **Customer Side:**
   - Log in as customer
   - Set `isRecUpdate = 2` (Email) or `3` (Both) in Account Settings
   - Go to Cars page
   - Click "Notify me when available" on any rented/unavailable car
   - Should see: "You'll be notified when the [Car] becomes available!"

2. **Admin Side:**
   - Log in as admin
   - Go to Manage Cars
   - Change the car's status to "Available"
   - Click Save

3. **Backend Logs (Check Terminal):**
   ```

   üîî Checking waitlist for car 7...
      üìã Found 1 customer(s) waiting for this car
   üì¨ Sending availability notification for Ford Granger to customer 10

      ‚Üí Sending Email to gregg.marayan@gmail.com

   ```

## Gmail App Password Setup (For Reference)

If you need to use a different Gmail account:

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Go to "App passwords"
4. Generate new app password for "Mail"
5. Copy the 16-character password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)
6. Update `.env`:
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password-here
   ```
7. Restart backend server

---

## Alternative Email Services

If you want to use a different email service provider:

### **SendGrid:**
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

```javascript
// In notificationService.js
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail';

sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

const msg = {
  to: email,
  from: 'noreply@jacarrental.com',
  subject: subject,
  text: body,
  html: htmlBody
};

await sgMail.send(msg);
```

### **AWS SES:**
```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-ses
```

### **Mailgun:**
```bash
npm install mailgun.js
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### **Email Not Sending:**

1. **Check logs for errors:**
   ```
   ‚ùå Email Error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted
   ```
   ‚Üí App Password is wrong or expired

2. **Check environment variables:**
   ```bash
   echo $EMAIL_USER
   echo $EMAIL_PASS
   ```

3. **Gmail blocking less secure apps:**
   - Use App Password (not regular password)
   - Enable 2-Step Verification first

4. **Email goes to spam:**
   - Customer should check spam folder
   - Add sender to contacts
   - In production, use custom domain with SPF/DKIM

### **isRecUpdate Value Issues:**

- **0**: No notification sent (expected behavior)
- **1**: SMS simulated (email not sent)
- **2**: ‚úÖ Email sent
- **3**: ‚úÖ Email sent, SMS simulated

To verify customer's isRecUpdate value:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, first_name, email, isRecUpdate 
FROM "Customer" 
WHERE customer_id = 10;
```

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Email Service**: FULLY WORKING
- Real emails sent via Gmail SMTP
- HTML formatting with styling
- Error handling and logging

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test with isRecUpdate = 2 (Email only) - READY TO TEST NOW
2. ‚úÖ Test with isRecUpdate = 3 (Both) - Email will work, SMS simulated
3. ‚è≥ Activate Semaphore SMS API for actual SMS sending
4. ‚è≥ Consider custom domain email (e.g., noreply@jacarrental.com)
5. ‚è≥ Add email templates with company logo/branding
6. ‚è≥ Implement email delivery tracking

---

1. Restart backend server
2. Set isRecUpdate to 2 or 3
3. Join waitlist for a car
4. Change car status to "Available" as admin
