## ✅ Issues Fixed

### **Issue 1: Extension Bookings Not Visible in BOOKINGS Tab**

**Problem:** Bookings with `isExtend=true` only appeared in the EXTENSION tab, not in the BOOKINGS tab.

**Solution:** Modified `getFilteredRows()` function in `AdminBookingPage.jsx` to allow extension bookings to appear in BOTH tabs:
- BOOKINGS tab now shows ALL bookings (including those with `isExtend=true`)
- EXTENSION tab still shows only bookings with `isExtend=true`
- This allows admins to see extension bookings in their normal workflow while having a dedicated tab for managing extensions

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminBookingPage.jsx`

**Code Change:**
```javascript
case 'BOOKINGS':
  // Show all confirmed, pending, and in progress bookings
  // Extension bookings (isExtend=true) will also appear here
  return filteredData;
```

---

### **Issue 2: Extend Button Showing During Extension Process**

**Problem:** The extend button was still visible even when an extension request was in progress, potentially allowing multiple extension requests for the same booking.

**Solution:** Enhanced the extend button visibility check to handle all boolean type variations (`true`, `'true'`, `'TRUE'`):

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerBookings.jsx`

**Code Change:**
```javascript
{booking.booking_status?.toLowerCase() === 'in progress' &&
  !booking.isExtend &&
  booking.isExtend !== true &&
  booking.isExtend !== 'true' &&
  booking.isExtend !== 'TRUE' && (
    <Button>Extend</Button>
  )}
```

---

### **Issue 3: No Context for Extension Approval Types**

**Problem:** In the admin's EXTENSION tab, there was no way to distinguish between:
1. New extension requests that need approval
2. Extension payments that need confirmation after customer paid

**Solution:** Added a new "Request Type" column in the EXTENSION tab that displays contextual, mobile-friendly messages:

- **📅 New extension request - Review & approve/reject** (blue) - When customer submits extension but hasn't paid
- **✅ Extension paid - Confirm to apply new date** (green) - When customer has paid and admin needs to confirm

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/ui/components/table/ManageBookingsTable.jsx`

**Features:**
- Responsive font sizes for mobile (`0.7rem` on xs, `0.75rem` on sm, `0.8rem` on md)
- `wordBreak: 'break-word'` and `whiteSpace: 'normal'` to prevent horizontal scrolling
- Color-coded messages (blue for new requests, green for paid confirmations)
- No overflow or text shrinking issues on mobile

---

### **Issue 4: Browser Alert for Extension Success**

**Problem:** After successful extension request, a browser alert (`localhost says...`) appeared, which was not user-friendly or aesthetically pleasing.

**Solution:** Replaced `alert()` with Material-UI Snackbar notification system:

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerBookings.jsx`

**Features:**
- Beautiful Material-UI Alert component with success/error styling
- Auto-dismisses after 6 seconds
- Positioned at top-right of screen
- Shows formatted booking details (additional cost, new total)
- Consistent with application design system

**Code Changes:**
- Added `Snackbar` import from `@mui/material`
- Added snackbar state management
- Created `showMessage()` and `handleCloseSnackbar()` handlers
- Updated `handleExtendBooking()` to use snackbar instead of alert
- Added Snackbar component to JSX

---

### **Other Fix 1: Time Validation for Multi-Day Bookings**

**Problem:** The booking modal required dropoff time to be after pickup time even for different dates. Example: Pickup Tuesday 7:30 AM, Dropoff Wednesday 7:00 AM was rejected, even though it's valid.

**Solution:** Modified time validation to only check time order for same-day bookings:

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/BookingModal.jsx`

**Logic:**
```javascript
// Check if start date and end date are the same
const startDateOnly = new Date(formData.startDate);
startDateOnly.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
const endDateOnly = new Date(formData.endDate);
endDateOnly.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

// Only validate time order if it's a same-day booking
if (startDateOnly.getTime() === endDateOnly.getTime()) {
  // Check dropoff time > pickup time
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Multi-day bookings can now have any valid working hours (7:00 AM - 7:00 PM)
- Same-day bookings still validate that dropoff time is after pickup time
- More flexible and user-friendly

### **Other Fix 2: Horizontal Scrolling in BookingModal on Mobile**

**Problem:** The booking modal was scrollable horizontally on mobile devices, creating an awkward user experience.

**Solution:** Comprehensive responsive design improvements:

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/BookingModal.jsx`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Dialog Paper:**
   - Added responsive margins: `{ xs: 1, sm: 2 }`
   - Dynamic width: `{ xs: 'calc(100% - 16px)', sm: 'calc(100% - 64px)' }`

2. **DialogTitle:**
   - Responsive padding: `px: { xs: 2, sm: 3 }, pt: { xs: 2, sm: 3 }`
   - Responsive font size: `{ xs: '1.1rem', sm: '1.25rem', md: '1.5rem' }`
   - Added `wordBreak: 'break-word'` for long car names

3. **DialogContent:**
   - Added `overflowX: 'hidden'` to prevent horizontal scroll
   - Responsive padding throughout all child containers

4. **DialogActions:**
   - Column layout on mobile, row on desktop: `flexDirection: { xs: 'column', sm: 'row' }`
   - Full-width buttons on mobile: `width: { xs: '100%', sm: 'auto' }`
   - Responsive gap: `{ xs: 1, sm: 2 }`

5. **Content Sections:**
   - All `px: 3` changed to `px: { xs: 2, sm: 3 }`
   - All `p: 3` changed to `p: { xs: 2, sm: 3 }`
   - Font sizes scaled down on mobile
   - Icons scaled: `{ xs: '1.5rem', sm: '2rem' }`

6. **Stepper:**
   - Responsive label font size: `{ xs: '0.75rem', sm: '0.875rem' }`

7. **Typography:**
   - All headings have responsive font sizes
   - Body text scales appropriately

**Result:**
- No horizontal scrolling on any mobile device
- All content fits within viewport
- Text remains readable (not shrunken)
- Professional appearance maintained
- Smooth user experience across all screen sizes

2. **Approve or Reject:**
   - **Approve:** Extension fee added to booking, customer notified to pay
   - **Reject:** Booking reverts to original state (`isExtend=false`, old dates restored)

3. **Confirm Payment:**
   - After customer pays, booking shows: **"✅ Extension paid - Confirm to apply new date"**
   - Admin clicks confirm
   - New end date is applied
