# Extension Booking Flow Fixes - October 22, 2025

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### **Issue 1: Extension Records Disappearing After Admin Approval** ✅

**Problem:**
- When admin approved an extension request, `isExtend` was set to `false` immediately
- `end_date` was updated to `new_end_date` right away
- Extension record disappeared from EXTENSION tab
- No way for admin to track that customer still needs to pay
- No way for admin to confirm payment for extension

**Root Cause:**
The `confirmExtensionRequest` function was treating "approval" as "completion" - it applied the new dates immediately instead of waiting for payment.

**Solution:**
Modified the extension flow to have proper stages:

**New Extension Flow:**
1. **Customer Requests Extension** → `isExtend=true`, `new_end_date` set, status stays "In Progress"
2. **Admin Approves Extension** → `isExtend=true` (stays true!), `isPay=false`, extension cost added to balance
   - Extension record created with `extension_status: "approved"`
   - Booking stays in EXTENSION tab
   - Shows: "💰 Extension approved - Awaiting customer payment"
3. **Customer Pays Extension Fee** → `isExtend=true`, `isPay=true`
   - Shows: "✅ Extension paid - Confirm to apply new date"
4. **Admin Confirms Payment** → `isExtend=false`, `end_date` updated to `new_end_date`, `new_end_date` cleared
   - Extension record updated to `extension_status: "completed"`
   - Booking removed from EXTENSION tab, stays in BOOKINGS tab

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js`
  - `confirmExtensionRequest()` - Keep `isExtend=true`, don't update `end_date` yet
  - `confirmBooking()` - CASE C enhanced to apply new dates when confirming extension payment

---

### **Issue 2: Browser Alert (localhost says...) Still Showing** ✅

**Problem:**
- After successful payment in Settlements tab, browser `alert()` was shown
- Not user-friendly or aesthetically pleasing

**Solution:**
- Replaced `alert()` in PaymentModal with callback that passes success message
- Updated `handlePaymentSuccess` in CustomerBookings to display Snackbar
- Now shows beautiful Material-UI notification with payment details

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/ui/components/modal/PaymentModal.jsx`
  - Removed `alert()` calls
  - Pass `successMessage` through `onPaymentSuccess` callback
  
- `frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerBookings.jsx`
  - Updated `handlePaymentSuccess(result)` to accept result parameter
  - Call `showMessage()` with success message from payment result

---

### **Issue 3: Extension Payment Not Showing in Correct Tab** ✅

**Problem:**
- After customer paid extension fee, booking appeared in BOOKINGS tab only
- Should still be in EXTENSION tab for admin to confirm payment

**Solution:**
This was fixed as part of Issue #1 - keeping `isExtend=true` ensures the booking stays in EXTENSION tab until admin confirms the payment.

---

### **Issue 4: new_end_date Becoming end_date Prematurely** ✅

**Problem:**
- Even if admin disapproved extension or customer cancelled or auto-cancel happened
- The `new_end_date` was still becoming the official `end_date`
- This happened because the dates were updated during approval, not after payment

**Solution:**
- Modified `confirmExtensionRequest()` to NOT update `end_date` or `dropoff_time`
- Dates only get updated in `confirmBooking()` CASE C, which runs AFTER payment confirmation
- If extension is rejected or cancelled, `new_end_date` is simply cleared

---

### **Issue 5: Customer Cannot Cancel Extension Request** ✅

**Problem:**
- 404 error when trying to cancel extension: `POST /bookings/49/cancel-extension`
- Browser console showed route not found

**Root Cause:**
The `cancelExtensionRequest` function was only looking for unapproved extensions:
```javascript
extensions: {
  where: {
    approve_time: null, // Only pending extensions
  }
}
```

But after admin approval, extensions have `extension_status: "approved"`, so they weren't found.

**Solution:**
Updated query to handle both unapproved and approved extensions:
```javascript
extensions: {
  where: {
    OR: [
      { approve_time: null }, // Unapproved extensions
      { extension_status: "approved" }, // Approved but unpaid extensions
    ],
  }
}
```

Now customers can cancel:
- Before admin approval
- After admin approval but before payment
- Cannot cancel after payment (isPay=true) - must complete the process

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js`
  - `cancelExtensionRequest()` - Updated extension query to include approved extensions

---

## 📊 Updated Extension Status Messages

The EXTENSION tab in `AdminBookingPage` now shows three distinct states:

### 1. **New Extension Request** (Blue)
**Message:** 📅 New extension request - Review & approve/reject

**Conditions:**
- `isExtend=true`
- `booking_status` = "In Progress"
- `isPay=false`
- No extension record with `extension_status: "approved"`

**Admin Actions:**
- ✓ Approve Extension (adds cost, keeps in tab)
- ✗ Reject Extension (reverts everything)

---

### 2. **Extension Approved - Awaiting Payment** (Orange)
**Message:** 💰 Extension approved - Awaiting customer payment

**Conditions:**
- `isExtend=true`
- `booking_status` = "In Progress"
- `isPay=false`
- Extension record exists with `extension_status: "approved"`

**Admin Actions:**
- None - waiting for customer to pay
- Customer sees this in Settlements tab

---

### 3. **Extension Paid - Awaiting Confirmation** (Green)
**Message:** ✅ Extension paid - Confirm to apply new date

**Conditions:**
- `isExtend=true`
- `booking_status` = "In Progress"
- `isPay=true`

**Admin Actions:**
- ✓ Confirm Payment (applies new dates, completes extension)
- After confirmation:
  - `end_date` → `new_end_date`
  - `isExtend` → `false`
  - Extension removed from EXTENSION tab
  - Extension record marked as "completed"

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Multiple Extension Requests
**Status:** Not supported
- Customer can only have ONE pending extension at a time
- `isExtend` flag prevents multiple simultaneous extensions
- After current extension completes, customer can request another

### 2. Extension After Extension
**Status:** Supported
- After first extension is completed and applied
- `isExtend` becomes `false`
- Customer can then request another extension
- Process repeats with new dates as baseline

### 3. Extension During Pending Status
**Status:** Not supported
- Extensions only allowed for "In Progress" bookings
- Customer must wait for booking to be released and car picked up
- This is by design - can't extend before car is even released
