# Extension Flow Fixes - Part 2 (October 22, 2024)

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Extension Not Being Applied After Payment
**Problem:** After customer pays and admin confirms, the extension stays in "approved" state instead of "completed", end_date doesn't update, and it asks for payment again.

**Root Cause:** 
- Multiple approved extensions accumulating
- CASE C logic running but not properly cleaning up all approved extensions
- Possible issue with transaction or database update timing

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added comprehensive logging to CASE C to trace execution
2. Added cleanup to mark ALL approved extensions as "completed" (not just one)
3. Enhanced error messages for debugging

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js` - CASE C with better logging and cleanup

### Issue 2: Approve/Reject Buttons Showing During "Awaiting Payment"
**Problem:** When extension is approved and awaiting customer payment, admin shouldn't see approve/reject buttons since they're just waiting.

**Fix Applied:**
Implemented 3-state button logic:
1. **New Request** (not approved) → Show Approve ✅ and Reject ❌ buttons
2. **Approved, Awaiting Payment** → Show NO buttons (admin waits)
3. **Customer Paid** → Show ONLY Confirm ✅ button

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/ui/components/table/ManageBookingsTable.jsx` - Action column button logic

## 🔧 Backend Changes

### Enhanced CASE C Logging
```javascript
// CASE C: isPay is TRUE and status is In Progress - Extension payment confirmation
else if (booking.isPay === true && normalizedStatus === "in progress") {
  console.log("📅 CASE C: Extension payment confirmed - Applying new end date...");
  console.log("📊 Current booking state:", {
    bookingId,
    isExtend: booking.isExtend,
    isPay: booking.isPay,
    new_end_date: booking.new_end_date,
    end_date: booking.end_date,
    balance: booking.balance,
  });
  
  // Check and log if extension is found
  if (!booking.isExtend || !booking.new_end_date) {
    console.log("❌ No pending extension found:", {
      isExtend: booking.isExtend,
      new_end_date: booking.new_end_date,
    });
    return res.status(400).json({
      error: "No pending extension found for this booking",
    });
  }
  
  // ... rest of logic
  
  // Find and update ALL approved extensions
  const approvedExtension = await prisma.extension.findFirst({
    where: {
      booking_id: bookingId,
      extension_status: "approved",
    },
    orderBy: { extension_id: "desc" },
  });

  console.log("🔍 Found approved extension:", approvedExtension);

  if (approvedExtension) {
    await prisma.extension.update({
      where: { extension_id: approvedExtension.extension_id },
      data: { extension_status: "completed" },
    });
    console.log(`✅ Marked extension #${approvedExtension.extension_id} as completed`);
  }

  // Cleanup: Mark any OTHER approved extensions as completed (duplicates)
  const otherApprovedExtensions = await prisma.extension.updateMany({
    where: {
      booking_id: bookingId,
      extension_status: "approved",
    },
    data: { extension_status: "completed" },
  });
  
  if (otherApprovedExtensions.count > 0) {
    console.log(`✅ Marked ${otherApprovedExtensions.count} additional approved extension(s) as completed`);
  }
  
  // ... update booking
  
  console.log("✅ Extension payment confirmed and applied:", {
    bookingId,
    oldEndDate: booking.end_date,
    newEndDate: updatedBooking.end_date,
    status: updatedBooking.booking_status,
    isExtend: updatedBooking.isExtend,
    isExtended: updatedBooking.isExtended,
    isPay: updatedBooking.isPay,
  });
}
```

## 🎨 Frontend Changes

### Conditional Button Rendering
```javascript
{activeTab === 'EXTENSION' && (() => {
  const latestExtension = params.row.latest_extension;
  const isExtensionApproved = latestExtension && 
                              (latestExtension.extension_status === 'approved' || 
                               latestExtension.approve_time !== null);
  const isPaid = params.row.isPay === true || 
                params.row.isPay === 'true' || 
                params.row.isPay === 'TRUE';
  
  if (isPaid) {
    // State 3: Customer paid → Show ONLY confirm button
    return <IconButton ... />;
  } else if (isExtensionApproved) {
    // State 2: Approved, awaiting payment → NO buttons
    return null;
  } else {
    // State 1: New request → Show approve/reject buttons
    return (
      <>
        <IconButton ... /> {/* Approve */}
        <IconButton ... /> {/* Reject */}
      </>
    );
  }
})()}
```

## 📊 Button States Summary

| Extension State | Display Message | Buttons Shown |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **New Request** (not approved) | 🔵 "New extension request - Review & approve/reject" | ✅ Approve, ❌ Reject |
| **Approved** (awaiting payment) | 🟠 "Extension approved - Awaiting customer payment" | **(None - admin waits)** |
| **Paid** (awaiting confirmation) | 🟢 "Extension paid - Confirm to apply new date" | ✅ Confirm only |

---

## 🧪 Testing After Fixes

### Current State (Fixed Manually)
Booking #49 has been manually fixed:
- ✅ Extension applied (end_date = Oct 23)
- ✅ All extensions marked as "completed"
- ✅ Flags cleared (isExtend=false, isPay=false)

### New Test Scenario
Since booking #49 is already extended, you can test with a NEW booking OR extend #49 again:

**Option 1: Test Another Extension on #49**
1. Customer requests ANOTHER extension (Oct 23 → Oct 24)
2. Admin approves (should see NO buttons after approval)
3. Customer pays
4. Admin confirms (should see ONLY confirm button, end date should update)

**Option 2: Test with Different Booking**
Find another "In Progress" booking and test the full flow.

---

## 🔍 Debugging Tools

### Check Booking State
```bash
cd backend
node query-customer-bookings.js
```

### Check Server Logs
When testing, watch the backend terminal for:
- "📅 CASE C: Extension payment confirmed..."
- "🔍 Found approved extension: ..."
- "✅ Marked extension #X as completed"
- "✅ Extension payment confirmed and applied: ..."

If CASE C doesn't run, check:
1. Is `isPay` true?
2. Is `booking_status` "In Progress"?
3. Are both conditions met?

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior Now

1. **Admin approves extension** → Buttons disappear (admin waits)
2. **Customer pays** → Confirm button appears
3. **Admin confirms** → Extension applied, end_date updated, booking moves to BOOKINGS tab
4. **No duplicate extensions** created
5. **Clear server logs** showing CASE C execution

---

## 📝 Files Modified Summary

1. `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js`
   - Enhanced CASE C logging
   - Added cleanup for ALL approved extensions
