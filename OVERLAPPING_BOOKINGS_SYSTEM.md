# Overlapping Bookings System - Income Maximization Feature ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** Implementation Complete  
**Priority:** High - Revenue Enhancement

---

## üìã Overview

Previously, when a car had an existing booking (even for future dates like November 1-5), the car was marked as "Rented" and **completely unavailable** for new bookings. This meant:

- Car sitting idle from October 22 - October 31 ‚ùå
- Lost revenue for 9+ days ‚ùå
- Customers forced to look elsewhere ‚ùå

**New System:** Customers can book the same car for non-conflicting dates, maximizing income by filling gaps between bookings! ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ Business Problem Solved

### Before:
**Scenario:** Customer A books car for November 1-5 (advance booking)
- **Today:** October 22
- **Car Status:** "Rented" (even though rental hasn't started)
- **Impact:** Car generates NO income for Oct 22-31 (9 days idle)
- **Customer Experience:** Other customers see "Notify me when available"

### After:
**Same Scenario:** Customer A books car for November 1-5
- **Today:** October 22
- **Car Status:** "Available" (until Nov 1)
- **Impact:** Customer B can book Oct 25-30 ‚úÖ
- **Income:** Additional 5 days of revenue!
- **Customer Experience:** "Book Now (View Availability)" with clear date restrictions

---

## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. **Backend Utilities** (`backend/src/utils/bookingUtils.js`)

Created comprehensive date conflict detection utilities:

```javascript
// Key Functions:
- dateRangesOverlap(start1, end1, start2, end2)
- getUnavailablePeriods(bookings, maintenanceDays = 1)
- validateBookingDates(requestedStart, requestedEnd, existingBookings)
- checkBookingConflict(requestedStart, requestedEnd, unavailablePeriods)
```

**Example:**
```javascript
// Existing booking: Nov 1-5
// Maintenance day: Nov 6
// Customer tries to book: Oct 25-30

const result = validateBookingDates(
  new Date('2025-10-25'),
  new Date('2025-10-30'),
  existingBookings,
  1 // 1-day maintenance
);

// Result: { isValid: true, message: 'Booking dates are available', conflicts: [] }
```

### 2. **New API Endpoint** 

**GET `/api/cars/:carId/unavailable-periods`**

Returns all blocked date ranges for a car:

```json
{
  "car_id": 7,
  "car_info": {
    "make": "Toyota",
    "model": "Vios",
    "year": 2024,
    "status": "Available"
  },
  "unavailable_periods": [
    {
      "start_date": "2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "end_date": "2025-11-05T00:00:00.000Z",
      "reason": "Booked by another customer",
      "is_maintenance": false,
      "booking_id": 123
    },
    {
      "start_date": "2025-11-06T00:00:00.000Z",
      "end_date": "2025-11-06T00:00:00.000Z",
      "reason": "Maintenance period",
      "is_maintenance": true,
      "booking_id": 123
    }
  ],
  "total_blocked_periods": 2,
  "active_bookings": 1
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Booking Validation** (`backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js`)

**In `createBooking` function:**

```javascript
// ‚úÖ NEW: Validate date conflicts
const existingBookings = await prisma.booking.findMany({
  where: {
    car_id: parseInt(car_id),
    booking_status: { in: ['Pending', 'Confirmed', 'In Progress'] },
    isCancel: false
  }
});

const dateValidation = validateBookingDates(
  startDateTime,
  endDateTime,
  existingBookings,
  1 // 1-day maintenance buffer
);

if (!dateValidation.isValid) {
  return res.status(409).json({
    error: "Date conflict",
    message: dateValidation.message,
    conflicts: dateValidation.conflicts,
    suggestion: "Please choose different dates..."
  });
}
```

**Updated Car Status Logic:**

```javascript
// ‚úÖ UPDATED: Only mark car as "Rented" if booking starts today or earlier
const today = new Date();
const bookingStart = new Date(startDateTime);

if (bookingStart <= today) {
  // Booking starts today - mark as rented
  await prisma.car.update({
    where: { car_id: parseInt(car_id) },
    data: { car_status: "Rented" }
  });
} else {
  // Advance booking - keep car available
  console.log(`Car ${car_id} status NOT changed - advance booking`);
}
```

### 4. **Frontend Updates**

#### **BookingModal.jsx**

**New State:**
```javascript
const [unavailablePeriods, setUnavailablePeriods] = useState([]);
const [hasDateConflict, setHasDateConflict] = useState(false);
```

**Fetch Unavailable Periods:**
```javascript
const fetchUnavailablePeriods = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/cars/${car.car_id}/unavailable-periods`);
  const data = await response.json();
  setUnavailablePeriods(data.unavailable_periods || []);
};
```

**Display Warning Box:**
```jsx
{unavailablePeriods && unavailablePeriods.length > 0 && (
  <Box sx={{ mb: 3, p: 3, backgroundColor: '#fff9e6', border: '2px solid #ff9800' }}>
    <Typography variant="h6">
      ‚ö†Ô∏è Unavailable Periods for This Car
    </Typography>
    
    {unavailablePeriods.map((period, index) => (
      <Card key={index} sx={{ backgroundColor: period.is_maintenance ? '#ffebee' : '#e3f2fd' }}>
        <CardContent>
          <Typography>
            üìÖ {formatDate(period.start_date)} - {formatDate(period.end_date)}
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="caption">
            {period.reason}
          </Typography>
          <Chip label={period.is_maintenance ? 'Maintenance' : 'Booked'} />
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    ))}
    
    <Alert severity="info">
      üí° Tip: Choose dates that don't overlap with the periods above.
    </Alert>
  </Box>
)}
```

#### **CustomerCars.jsx**

**Updated Button Handler:**
```javascript
const handleCarClick = async (car) => {
  const carStatus = String(car.car_status || '').toLowerCase();
  
  // Only block if car is under maintenance
  if (carStatus.includes('maint')) {
    return; // Button disabled
  }
  
  // ‚úÖ CHANGED: Allow booking modal for rented cars
  // The modal will show unavailable periods
  setSelectedCar(car);
  setShowBookingModal(true);
};
```

**Updated Button Text:**
```jsx
{car.car_status?.toLowerCase().includes('maint')
  ? 'Under Maintenance'
  : car.car_status?.toLowerCase().includes('rent')
    ? 'Book Now (View Availability)'  // ‚úÖ CHANGED from "Notify me when available"
    : 'Book Now'}
```

---

## üóìÔ∏è Maintenance Day Rules

**Automatic 1-Day Buffer:**

Every booking includes an automatic 1-day maintenance period **after** the rental ends.

**Example:**
```
Booking: November 1-5 (customer rents car)
Maintenance: November 6 (automatic buffer - car cleaned, inspected, serviced)
```

**Why Maintenance Day Matters:**

1. **Physical Preparation:** Car must be cleaned, inspected, refueled
2. **Quality Assurance:** Ensures next customer receives car in perfect condition
3. **Safety Check:** Time for any repairs or maintenance issues
4. **Business Logic:** Prevents back-to-back rentals without service

**Conflict Rules:**

‚ùå **REJECTED Scenario:**
```
Existing: Booking A (Nov 1-5) + Maintenance (Nov 6)
Customer tries: Booking B (Oct 31 - Nov 2)
Result: REJECTED - conflicts with existing booking
```

‚ùå **REJECTED Scenario:**
```
Existing: Booking A (Nov 1-5) + Maintenance (Nov 6)
Customer tries: Booking B (Nov 6-10)
Result: REJECTED - conflicts with maintenance period
```

‚úÖ **ACCEPTED Scenario:**
```
Existing: Booking A (Nov 1-5) + Maintenance (Nov 6)
Customer tries: Booking B (Oct 25-30)
Result: ACCEPTED - no overlap with existing periods
```

‚úÖ **ACCEPTED Scenario:**
```
Existing: Booking A (Nov 1-5) + Maintenance (Nov 6)
Customer tries: Booking B (Nov 7-12)
Result: ACCEPTED - starts after maintenance completes
```

## üìä Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Advance Booking + Gap Filling ‚úÖ

**Setup:**
- Today: October 22, 2025
- Booking A: November 1-5 (Customer A - advance booking)
- Maintenance: November 6

**Test:**
1. **Booking B (Oct 25-30):** ‚úÖ SHOULD SUCCEED
   - Dates: Oct 25-30
   - No conflict with Nov 1-6
   - Result: Accepted, generates revenue for 5 days

2. **Booking C (Oct 31 - Nov 2):** ‚ùå SHOULD FAIL
   - Dates: Oct 31 - Nov 2
   - Conflicts with Booking A (Nov 1-5)
   - Error: "Date conflict with existing booking"

3. **Booking D (Nov 6-10):** ‚ùå SHOULD FAIL
   - Dates: Nov 6-10
   - Conflicts with Maintenance (Nov 6)
   - Error: "Date conflict with maintenance period"

4. **Booking E (Nov 7-12):** ‚úÖ SHOULD SUCCEED
   - Dates: Nov 7-12
   - No conflict (starts after maintenance)
   - Result: Accepted

### Scenario 2: Same-Day Booking Status Change

**Test:**
```javascript
// Booking starts today (Oct 22)
const bookingData = {
  start_date: new Date('2025-10-22'),
  end_date: new Date('2025-10-25')
};

// Expected: Car status ‚Üí "Rented" immediately
```

**Test:**
```javascript
// Booking starts in future (Nov 1)
const bookingData = {
  start_date: new Date('2025-11-01'),
  end_date: new Date('2025-11-05')
};

// Expected: Car status ‚Üí remains "Available"
// Allows other customers to book Oct 22-31
```
