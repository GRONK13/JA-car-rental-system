# Payment Received Notifications - Quick Reference

## ✅ What Was Added

Payment received notifications that confirm to customers when their payments have been received.

## 🎯 Trigger Points

### GCash Payments
**When**: Admin approves the GCash payment request (clicks "Confirm" button)  
**Why**: Staff needs to verify the GCash transaction first before confirming receipt

### Cash Payments  
**When**: Staff records the cash payment in the system (immediately)  
**Why**: Staff is physically receiving cash, no verification delay needed
