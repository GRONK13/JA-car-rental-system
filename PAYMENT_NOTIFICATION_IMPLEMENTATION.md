# Payment Received Notifications - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary
Added SMS and email notifications to confirm when customer payments (GCash or Cash) have been received by JA Car Rental.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. GCash Payment Notifications
- **Trigger**: When admin approves GCash payment request
- **Why delayed**: Staff needs to verify the transaction first
- **Location**: `confirmBooking()` in `bookingController.js`

### 2. Cash Payment Notifications  
- **Trigger**: Immediately when staff records cash payment
- **Why immediate**: Staff physically received cash, no verification needed
- **Location**: `createPayment()` in `paymentController.js`

### 3. Dual-Channel Delivery
- Always sends both SMS and Email
- Non-blocking (failures don't prevent payment processing)

## 📝 Code Changes

### File 1: `backend/src/utils/notificationService.js`
**Added**: `sendPaymentReceivedNotification()` function (80+ lines)

**What it does**:
- Formats payment confirmation messages
- Shows payment amount, method, reference number
- Displays remaining balance
- Sends via SMS and Email simultaneously

```javascript
export async function sendPaymentReceivedNotification(
  payment,      // Payment details
  customer,     // Customer contact info
  car,          // Vehicle details
  booking,      // Booking info
  paymentType   // 'gcash' or 'cash'
)
```

### File 2: `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js`
**Modified**: `confirmBooking()` function

**Added logic**:
```javascript
// After admin clicks confirm, before status update
const latestPayment = await prisma.payment.findFirst({
  where: { booking_id: bookingId },
  orderBy: { paid_date: 'desc' }
});

if (latestPayment && latestPayment.payment_method === 'GCash') {
  await sendPaymentReceivedNotification(
    latestPayment,
    customer,
    car,
    booking,
    'gcash'
  );
}
```

**Why here**: This is where admin approval happens (isPay = true → confirmation)

### File 3: `backend/src/controllers/paymentController.js`
**Modified**: `createPayment()` function

**Added logic**:
```javascript
// After payment created, before booking status update
if (payment_method === 'Cash') {
  await sendPaymentReceivedNotification(
    created,
    customer,
    car,
    updatedBooking,
    'cash'
  );
}
```

**Why here**: This is where staff records any payment (including cash)
