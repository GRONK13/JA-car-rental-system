## Technical Implementation

### New Function Added: `sendPaymentReceivedNotification()`

**Location**: `backend/src/utils/notificationService.js`

**Parameters**:
- `payment` - Payment object with amount, method, reference details
- `customer` - Customer object with contact information
- `car` - Car object with vehicle details
- `booking` - Booking object with dates and amounts
- `paymentType` - String: 'gcash' or 'cash'

**Behavior**:
- Always sends both SMS and Email (dual-channel)
- Non-blocking - failures don't prevent payment processing
- Includes remaining balance information
- Shows different messages based on payment completion status

### Modified Controllers

#### 1. **bookingController.js**
```javascript
// Added import
import { sendPaymentReceivedNotification } from "../utils/notificationService.js";

// In confirmBooking() - After isPay check, before booking confirmation
// Get the latest payment for this booking
const latestPayment = await prisma.payment.findFirst({
  where: { booking_id: bookingId },
  orderBy: { paid_date: 'desc' }
});

// Send notification if it's a GCash payment
if (latestPayment && latestPayment.payment_method === 'GCash') {
  await sendPaymentReceivedNotification(
    latestPayment,
    customer,
    car,
    booking,
    'gcash'
  );
}
```

#### 2. **paymentController.js**
```javascript
// Added import
import { sendPaymentReceivedNotification } from "../utils/notificationService.js";

// In createPayment() - After payment creation and booking update
// Send notification for Cash payments immediately
if (payment_method === 'Cash') {
  await sendPaymentReceivedNotification(
    created,
    customer,
    car,
    updatedBooking,
    'cash'
  );
}
```

## Important Notes

### Why Different Triggers?
- **GCash**: Notification sent when admin **approves** (not when customer submits)
  - Reason: Staff needs to verify the GCash transaction first
  - Customer gets notification only after staff confirms receipt
  
- **Cash**: Notification sent **immediately** when recorded
  - Reason: Staff is physically receiving cash, no verification delay needed
  - Notification confirms the payment was properly recorded

### Notification Sequence
When a payment is made:
1. **First**: Payment received notification (this feature)
2. **Then** (if applicable): Booking confirmation notification (if total ‚â• ‚Ç±1,000)

This ensures customers get:
- Immediate confirmation their payment was received
- Separate confirmation their booking is now confirmed (if threshold met)

### Error Handling
- All notification calls are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Notification failures are logged but don't prevent payment processing
- Uses `console.log` with emojis for easy tracking:
  - üí∞ Payment notification being sent
  - ‚úÖ Notification sent successfully
  - ‚ùå Notification failed
