# Phone Verification System - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## What Was Implemented

### ‚úÖ Backend (Complete)
1. **SMS Service** (`backend/src/utils/smsService.js`)
   - Semaphore API integration with sender name "JACarRental"
   - Philippine phone number formatting and validation
   - 6-digit OTP generation
   - Purpose-specific SMS messages

2. **Phone Verification Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/phoneVerificationController.js`)
   - Send OTP endpoint with 2-minute rate limiting
   - Verify OTP endpoint with 5 attempt limit
   - 10-minute OTP expiration
   - Automatic user phone_verified status update

3. **Database Schema**
   - Added `user_id`, `user_type`, `purpose` to PhoneVerification table
   - Added `phone_verified` field to Customer and Driver tables
   - Updated using `npx prisma db push` (safe for existing data)

4. **API Routes**
   - POST `/api/phone-verification/send-otp`
   - POST `/api/phone-verification/verify-otp`
   - POST `/api/phone-verification/resend-otp`
   - GET `/api/phone-verification/check/:phoneNumber`

### ‚úÖ Frontend Registration (Complete)
1. **Phone Verification Modal** (`frontend/src/components/PhoneVerificationModal.jsx`)
   - 6-digit OTP input with auto-focus
   - Auto-submit when complete
   - Paste support for codes
   - 10-minute countdown timer
   - Resend button (2-minute cooldown)
   - Attempts tracking display

2. **Registration Flow Updated** (`frontend/src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx`)
   - Upload license ‚Üí Send OTP ‚Üí Verify phone ‚Üí Complete registration
   - Pending registration data stored until verification
   - Success message includes phone verification confirmation

## How It Works

### Registration Flow:
```
1. User fills registration form
2. System uploads license image
3. System sends OTP to phone via Semaphore SMS
4. Phone Verification Modal opens
5. User receives SMS: "JACarRental: Your verification code is XXXXXX..."
6. User enters 6-digit code
7. System verifies OTP
8. Registration completes with phone_verified=true
```

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Registration
1. Go to registration page
2. Fill all fields with Philippine phone number (e.g., 09171234567)
3. Upload license image
4. Click Register
5. OTP modal appears
6. Check backend console - in development mode, OTP will be logged:
   ```
   üì± Development Mode: OTP Code for +639171234567 is: 123456
   ```
7. Enter the OTP code
8. Registration completes!

## Important Notes

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- Phone number validation (Philippine formats)
- OTP sending via Semaphore SMS
- OTP verification with attempts tracking
- Rate limiting (2 min cooldown)
- OTP expiration (10 minutes)
- Auto-submit when all 6 digits entered
- Paste support for codes
- Development mode OTP logging

### ‚è≥ Still TODO
- Customer Settings phone change verification
- Driver Settings phone change verification

### üîí Security Features
- Rate limiting: 1 OTP per 2 minutes
- Max attempts: 5 tries per OTP
- Expiration: OTPs expire after 10 minutes
- Duplicate prevention: Phone can't be verified by multiple accounts

### üì± Supported Phone Formats
All these formats work:
- `09171234567`
- `9171234567`
- `639171234567`
- `+639171234567`

All convert to: `+639171234567`

## Development vs Production

### Development Mode
- OTP visible in backend console logs
- OTP included in API response (for testing)
- Faster testing without actual SMS

### Production Mode
Set `NODE_ENV=production` in backend/.env to:
- Hide OTP from console logs
- Remove OTP from API responses
- Require actual SMS delivery

## SMS Message Examples

### Registration OTP:
```
JACarRental: Your verification code is 123456. 
Valid for 10 minutes. Do not share this code.
```

### Phone Change OTP:
```
JACarRental: Verify your new phone number with code: 123456. 
Valid for 10 minutes.
```

### Success Message:
```
JACarRental: Your phone number has been verified successfully!
```

## Environment Configuration

### Backend `.env` (Already Configured)
```env
SEMAPHORE_API_KEY=3724e4af6df4b4ff08ef07596e05f5d9
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Sender Name:** Fixed as "JACarRental" in code

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- ‚úÖ `backend/src/utils/smsService.js`
- ‚úÖ `backend/src/controllers/phoneVerificationController.js`
- ‚úÖ `backend/src/routes/phoneVerificationRoutes.js`
- ‚úÖ `frontend/src/components/PhoneVerificationModal.jsx`

### Modified:
- ‚úÖ `backend/src/index.js` (added phone verification routes)
- ‚úÖ `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` (added phone_verified fields)
- ‚úÖ `frontend/src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx` (added OTP verification flow)

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Ensure backend is running:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   You should see: "Server is running on port 3001"

2. **Register a new user:**
   - Use a valid Philippine phone number
   - Complete the form
   - You'll see the OTP modal
   - Check backend console for the OTP code
   - Enter the code and verify

3. **Check verification:**
   - After successful registration, user's `phone_verified` field is `true`
   - Phone number is stored as `contact_no` in formatted form (+63...)

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Check if port 3001 is available
- Verify `.env` file exists with SEMAPHORE_API_KEY

### OTP not sending
- In development, OTP is logged to console (check backend terminal)
- Verify phone number is Philippine format
- Check rate limiting (wait 2 minutes between attempts)

### OTP verification fails
- Check if OTP has expired (10 min limit)
- Verify exact phone number format matches
- Check attempts count (max 5 attempts)

### Modal doesn't appear
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify frontend is connected to backend
- Check if registration form validation passed

## Next Steps

To complete the phone verification system:

1. **Implement phone verification in Customer Settings**
   - When user changes phone number in settings
   - Send OTP to new number
   - Verify before saving

2. **Implement phone verification in Driver Settings**
   - Same flow as Customer Settings

See `PHONE_VERIFICATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed documentation.
