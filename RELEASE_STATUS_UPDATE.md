# Release Booking Status Update

## Overview

Updated the release process to automatically set `isRelease` to `true` and `booking_status` to `'In Progress'` when a car is released to a customer.

## Changes Made

### Backend: `releaseController.js`

**Location:** `backend/src/controllers/releaseController.js`

**Updated Function:** `createRelease`

**Changes:**
After creating a release record, the system now updates the associated booking with:

```javascript
await prisma.booking.update({
  where: { booking_id: Number(booking_id) },
  data: {
    isRelease: true,
    booking_status: "In Progress",
  },
});
```

## Booking Status Flow

The complete booking status flow is now:

1. **Pending** - Initial booking created, awaiting admin approval
2. **Confirmed** - Admin approved the booking
3. **In Progress** - Car has been released to customer (isRelease = true)
4. **Completed** - Car has been returned (isReturned = true)
5. **cancelled** - Booking was cancelled

## Why These Changes?

### `isRelease` Flag

- **Purpose:** Tracks whether the car has been physically released to the customer
- **Set to `true`:** When release form is submitted successfully
- **Use Cases:**
  - Prevents duplicate releases
  - Enables return functionality (can only return if released)
  - Dashboard analytics and reporting
  - Vehicle tracking and availability

### `booking_status` Update to 'In Progress'

- **Purpose:** Provides clear status visibility throughout the booking lifecycle
- **Benefits:**
  - Easier to identify active rentals
  - Better filtering and reporting
  - Consistent with the booking workflow
  - Aligns with other status transitions in the system

## Database Schema Reference

### Booking Model

```prisma
model Booking {
  // ... other fields
  isRelease      Boolean?      @default(false)
  isReturned     Boolean?      @default(false)
  booking_status String?
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Available Booking Statuses

- `Pending` - Initial state
- `Confirmed` - Approved by admin
- `In Progress` - Car released to customer
- `Completed` - Car returned
- `cancelled` - Booking cancelled

## Impact on Frontend

The ReleaseModal (`frontend/src/ui/components/modal/ReleaseModal.jsx`) already handles the release process correctly. No changes needed on the frontend as the backend automatically updates these fields.

## Testing Checklist

After implementing these changes, verify:

1. ✅ **Create Release:**

   - Submit a release form through ReleaseModal
   - Check that `isRelease` is set to `true` in the database
   - Check that `booking_status` is set to `'In Progress'`

2. ✅ **Check Console Logs:**

   - Backend should log: "Release created and booking updated" with the booking details

3. ✅ **Verify Schedule Table:**

   - Released bookings should show updated status
   - Status badge should reflect "In Progress"

4. ✅ **Verify Return Process:**

   - Only released bookings (isRelease = true) should be returnable
   - Return modal should have access to release data

5. ✅ **Check Analytics:**
   - In Progress bookings should appear in active rentals count
   - Dashboard statistics should be accurate

## API Endpoint

**POST** `/api/releases`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "booking_id": 123,
  "drivers_id": 456,
  "equipment": "complete",
  "equip_others": "Spare tire, Jack, etc.",
  "gas_level": "High",
  "license_presented": true
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Release created successfully",
  "release": {
    "release_id": 789,
    "booking_id": 123,
    "drivers_id": 456
    // ... other release fields
  }
}
```

**Side Effects:**

- Creates a `Release` record
- Updates `Booking.isRelease` to `true`
- Updates `Booking.booking_status` to `'In Progress'`

## Error Handling

The update is wrapped in the same try-catch block as the release creation:

- If the booking update fails, the entire transaction should be rolled back
- Error messages are logged to console
- HTTP 500 response returned to client

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback this change:

1. Remove the booking update code from `releaseController.js`:

```javascript
// Remove these lines:
await prisma.booking.update({
  where: { booking_id: Number(booking_id) },
  data: {
    isRelease: true,
    booking_status: "In Progress",
  },
});
```

2. Restart the backend server

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:

- Transaction wrapper for atomic operations
- Webhook/notification when booking status changes
- Status change history logging
- Automated status transitions based on dates
