# Waitlist Display Fix - Frontend

## Date: October 16, 2025

## Issue
When clicking "Show Details" in the "Your Waitlist Entries" section, the application crashed with error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'make')
```

## Root Cause
Two issues:
1. **Incorrect relation name**: Frontend was using lowercase `entry.car.make` but Prisma schema uses capitalized `entry.Car.make`
2. **Removed fields**: Code was trying to display `position`, `requested_start_date`, `requested_end_date` which were removed in the schema simplification

## Solution
Updated `frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerCars.jsx` line 852-865 to:
- Use capitalized relation name `entry.Car` instead of `entry.car`
- Remove references to deleted fields (`position`, `requested_start_date`, `requested_end_date`)
- Display relevant fields instead: `car_status` and `created_at`

### Before:
```jsx
<Typography variant="body1" sx={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
  {entry.car.make} {entry.car.model} ({entry.car.year})
</Typography>
<Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
  Position #{entry.position} • Requested:{' '}
  {new Date(entry.requested_start_date).toLocaleDateString()} - {new Date(entry.requested_end_date).toLocaleDateString()}
</Typography>
```

### After:
```jsx
<Typography variant="body1" sx={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
  {entry.Car.make} {entry.Car.model} ({entry.Car.year})
</Typography>
<Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
  Status: {entry.Car.car_status} • Joined:{' '}
  {new Date(entry.created_at).toLocaleDateString()}
</Typography>
```

## Display Now Shows:
- ✅ Car make, model, and year
- ✅ Current car status (Available/Rented/Maintenance)
- ✅ Date when customer joined the waitlist

## Testing
1. Log in as customer
2. Join waitlist for a car
3. View "Your Waitlist Entries" section
4. Click "Show Details"
5. Should display:
